<p>Job 19:25-27 (NIV) <i><sup>25</sup>I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth. <sup>26</sup>And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; <sup>27</sup>I myself will see him with my own eyes&#8211;I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!</i></p>

<p class="indent">Job's friends continued to insist that Job face up to the sin that had caused his miserable condition. Job continues to tell them he can't find one. Of course he was not perfect, nor is anyone. He couldn't find an issue to repent of. There are times when we suffer the consequences of other's sins. There are times when there may be a heavenly battle over us, such as this case with Job. What did Job cling to through it all? What kept him from following his wife's advice and cursing God? He trusted in the perfect character of God.</p>
<p class="indent">He knew that God was his Redeemer. That is the Gospel. Though these ancient people had only oral tradition to go on, Job knew God was his Redeemer. He also knew that one day his Redeemer would physically stand upon the earth. Even though he died and rotted away, he believed he would see that day. He longed for it, because then he knew he would then understand what it was all about.</p>
<p class="indent">You may have sorrow in your life that you cannot find the reason or plan of God in. You can't see any good that comes from it. Do as Job did and put your hope in the day when you will see God. God will ever be perfect and just. You can be sure that there are reasons for all things, and that they are good reasons. He is sovereign over all. Evil is not without boundaries. All things will have meaning and purpose. Place your hope in the day you will see Him face to face and all your questions answered.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Your Redeemer lives. Does your heart yearn for that day?</p>
