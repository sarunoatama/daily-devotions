<p>Exodus 2:5-9 (NIV) <i><sup>5</sup>Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it. <sup>6</sup>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said. <sup>7</sup>Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?" <sup>8</sup>"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother. <sup>9</sup>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you."</i></p>

<p class="indent">God kept His promise and made Israel a great nation during their 400-year stay in Egypt. In fact, they became so great that the Pharaoh ordered all baby boys thrown into the Nile to keep the Israelites from becoming too powerful. There was a spiritual war taking place. The time had come for the LORD to raise up a deliverer, and Satan knew it. He planted fear in Pharaoh's mind so that he would kill the male babies being born. He used the same tactic when Jesus, the Great Deliverer, was born. But the Divine hand of God works even through the evil of men to save lives, just as we saw in the story of Joseph.</p>
<p class="indent">The mother of Moses put him in a basket, and Providence guided the basket to the place where the Princess of Egypt had come to bathe. Baby Moses cried, and her heart melted. God used the most powerful of nations to give His deliverer an education in all the world's wisdom. He would have to make a choice between the world and his God.</p>
<p class="indent">Who was hired to nurse and care for him but Moses' own mother. I love the way God so utterly turns Satan's tactics around to bless the children of God. It may seem like the Enemy has brought defeat into your life. Remember, the Enemy fights the most vehemently when he senses deliverance is at hand.</p>
<p class="comment">Encouragement: Hold on, and trust in the wonderful ability of God to turn your circumstances into a mighty victory.</p>
