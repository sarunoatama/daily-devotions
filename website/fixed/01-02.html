<p>Genesis 1:2 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</i></p>

<p class="indent">God takes things from disorder to order. He does so in our lives too, if we will let Him. As God began working with the formless matter, the Spirit hovered or brooded over the waters. In Revelation we see that waters can represent people. If we think of this passage in a figurative sense, we see the Spirit of God like a mother hen brooding over the people of the world, trying to keep them from the predator. It is under the cover of darkness that predators attack, so the Spirit covers and protects us.</p>
<p class="indent">Then God sends His Light into the world. <i>And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</i> Genesis 1:3 (NIV) John the Beloved told us in the first chapter of his gospel that Jesus was the Light that lights every man that comes into the world. He shined in the darkness but the darkness did not understand. Do you understand that the Light has shined upon you? What will you do with that Light? The Holy Spirit has hovered over you, too.</p>
<p class="indent">John went on to say that His own did not receive Him, but as many as did receive Him He gave the power to be sons of God. Receive Him and all that He should be to you today! Let Him bring order to the formlessness and emptiness of your life.</p>
