<p>Acts 19:9-11 (NIV) <i><sup>9</sup>But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. <sup>10</sup>This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord. <sup>11</sup>God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,</i></p>

<p class="indent">At Ephesus Paul met a small band of disciples that had been baptized by John the Baptist. He preached Christ to them, and they were baptized in Jesus' name and filled with the Holy Spirit. Then Paul began to speak in the Synagogue. At that time, some referred to faith in Jesus as The Way. When people become abusive, it is often because they refuse to listen even when they know they are wrong. Because they cannot use reason, they turn to insults.</p>
<p class="indent">It seems that it was Paul's pattern to preach in the local Synagogue until they would hear him no more. Then he would teach those who had come to faith in a nearby home. Though he stayed in this one place for two years teaching, all of Asia heard the Word. The Word transformed those who received it and caused them to be a testimony wherever they went. God had given Paul such a gift of healing that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him brought healing to the sick. This was a sign to the spiritually hungry that Paul was teaching the truth about Jesus.</p>
<p class="indent">We often think of revival as something that comes suddenly. In this case it slowly built up over several years as Paul faithfully taught the Gospel. It is a work of God to bring revival or renewal. It is our job to faithfully proclaim the Gospel and live a life that is an example of it. Wherever you are, don't be discouraged if things are not happening quickly. Our work is to be faithful to the Holy Spirit. Not everywhere that Paul went experienced renewal like Ephesus. Remember, it was more common for him to be chased out of town.</p>
