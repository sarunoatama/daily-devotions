<p>Isaiah 52:13-15 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>See, my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted. <sup>14</sup>Just as there were many who were appalled at him&#8211; his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness&#8211; <sup>15</sup>so will he sprinkle many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Isaiah gave a number of prophecies about the suffering servant. They so beautifully describe the life of Jesus that it is a wonder some cannot see it and that the Jews of that day did not recognize Him. The wisest thing Jesus could have done for those He loved was to lay down His life. In the passage today, we see the cross raised, lifted into place, and the Son of God highly exalted. Though His body was beaten and torn beyond human recognition, He became the sacrifice whose blood would be our atonement.</p>
<p class="indent">Kings bow before the wonder of His sacrificial death. They cannot speak in the presence of One whose love is so great that He would die to give them life. Pilate did not know the prophecies were being fulfilled before his eyes. Kings have not heard the Gospel and yet somehow will know that God has made a Way. God has revealed His Arm, Christ Jesus, and ever since the world has looked in awe at the wonder of His life and death in our place.</p>
<p class="indent">Who would ever have guessed that God loved us to that extent? We sit in silence pondering the amazing love of God and our lack of gratitude for it. How could He love us so? The suffering Servant bore our sins that we might forever be right with God. Let the wonder of it grow within your heart.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: See that you never grow calloused toward that great display of His love for you.</p>
