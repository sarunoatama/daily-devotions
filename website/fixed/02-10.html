<p>Exodus 17:6 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink." So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Horeb was the mountain upon which Moses met God in the burning bush. The word 'horeb' means 'fresh inspiration'. Moses had indeed received fresh inspiration that transformed his life and sent him on his life's mission. Now he is at the same mountain with several million thirsty, whining people. He needs some fresh inspiration again. It is not as though we meet God one time and go on living on that one encounter. God is after a relationship. Difficulties are often the vehicle that drives us to seek direction from God, a fresh encounter.</p>
<p class="indent">Moses told the LORD that the people were ready to stone him for leading them to this dry and thirsty land. It was not Moses but God who led them there to show them their need and His all-sufficiency. First, God reassured fretting Moses by telling him that He will stand before him. Moses knew from experience that if Almighty God was in something, it would turn out fine. Then God gave Moses a strange command. God told him to strike the rock with the staff that God had first anointed in this same place.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1 Corinthians 10, the Apostle Paul tells us that this rock is Christ. He is struck, and the life giving water comes out to meet the need of every thirsty person in that great multitude. The Rock has been struck for you and water has flowed in abundance. <i>"Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters..." </i>Isaiah 55:1a (NIV)</p>
<p class="comment">Encouragement: Drink your fill; He was struck for you.</p>
