<p>1 Kings 8:59-61 (NIV) <i><sup>59</sup>And may these words of mine, which I have prayed before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel according to each day's need, <sup>60</sup>so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God and that there is no other. <sup>61</sup>But your hearts must be fully committed to the LORD our God, to live by his decrees and obey his commands, as at this time."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple is worth taking time to study. The end of that prayer is our Scripture today. He asks that this prayer be continually before the LORD and to uphold their cause. The reason he is bold enough to ask this is verse 60,<i>so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God and that there is no other. </i>This was God's heart. If Israel would truly live in relationship with God, then the world would receive the witness of God's faithfulness and love. The world would know there is no other god. That was God's intention in forming Israel as a nation, to witness to the world the blessing of obedience and worship of the one true God.</p>
<p class="indent">BUT, there is always a condition. That is because we are creatures with a free will. BUT, <i>your hearts must be fully committed to the LORD our God. </i>It is the same today. You are the only bible that many will read. God will hear your prayer and uphold your cause, BUT your heart must be fully committed to Him. If people look to you as a person in relationship with God but your walk does not match your talk, they will be misled. But if you are fully committed, even with your mistakes, they will see an example. The eyes of Israel had been on David when he fell, but because his heart was fully committed, they saw an example of conviction and repentance. They saw a humbled man.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Is there room for any other loyalty in your heart, or are you FULLY committed? If at this time you are fully committed, see that you stay that way. Then you can know that the LORD will hear your prayer and uphold your cause.</p>
