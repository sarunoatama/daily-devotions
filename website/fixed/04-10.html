<p>Deuteronomy 18:10-11 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, <sup>11</sup>or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.</i></p>

<p class="indent">All these actions are trying to find out the things of the spiritual world without going through God. The demonic realm loves to take the place of God. They are real and they are cunning. They will sometimes tell the truth, but for the purpose of deceiving you in the end. The goal is to tell you what you want to hear to lead you down a road of destruction. The ruinous path of evil is well documented.</p>
<p class="indent">The people of God were to have nothing to do with these ways. Most religions of that ancient time have died out, but these demonic counterfeits continue just as they did millennia ago. They can still be found in almost every city of the world. Avoid them like the plague. Pray them out of your city. Warn your friends that dabble in them. The only source of truth about the spiritual realm that is healthy and whole is the Holy Spirit through God's word.</p>
<p class="indent">It is good to do an inventory and see that none of these things have invaded your home. Warn your children when they are mature enough to understand. As the world comes closer to the end of days, we will see these more blatantly expressed and will be ridiculed for speaking against them. It is not the person we condemn but the power that uses them and the deception that is spoken. Be sure and read tomorrow's devotion that follows up on this line of thought.</p>
<p class="comment">Pray: Lord, keep these influences from finding a foothold in my family and city.</p>
