<p>Exodus 40:34-35 (NIV) <i><sup>34</sup>Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. <sup>35</sup>Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Once the tabernacle was set up according to the instructions Moses received on the mountain, the cloud that had been leading them settled upon it. The glory of the LORD so filled the Tent of Meeting that he could not enter.</p>
<p class="indent">Today the tent of meeting is your spirit. God desires to so fill you that your life is overflowing with Him, and little room is left for self to enter in. That is complete Christ likeness. He is taking us all to that place, individually and corporately. One day the work will be done and everything in place, and the glory of the LORD will completely fill us, the tabernacles, and the Tabernacle. He has always been in the process of making a dwelling place for Himself.</p>
<p class="indent">The day of completion is the wedding feast of the Lamb. When we see Him we will be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is (1 John 3:1-2). When we are like Him, He can fill us completely. We have a deposit now, a deposit of the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:13-14). That is deposit of what will someday be in all His fullness. We experience it more and more as we grow in Him.</p>
<p class="indent">"Heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool; what house will you build me?" says the Lord, "and what shall be the place of my rest?" (Acts 7:49)" Upon this rock I will build my church..." (Matthew 16:18) They that believe have entered into rest (Hebrews 4:3a).</p>
