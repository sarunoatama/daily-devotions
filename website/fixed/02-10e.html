<p>Matthew 7:7-8, 12 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. <sup>8</sup>For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>12</sup>So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Man has a tendency to act as if heaven was stingy. We go to God and ask as if His resources were limited. Our poverty in asking, seeking and knocking reflects our poverty of understanding the gracious heart of our Father. He speaks, and resources come into existence. Perhaps we have this mistaken attitude because we so often see people who will not go to Him for their needs. We refuse to hear His answer to our need, and so we continue in our impoverished ways.</p>
<p class="indent">God is more willing to give than we are to receive. Heaven is filled with answers to prayers that are yet to be prayed. When we get a right attitude about God's attitude, we find our own attitude toward giving is changed. If I believe He desires to share His all-sufficiency with me, I have no problem sharing with others in need. Then I can do to others what I would hope that they would do to me. I don't have that greedy attitude that says I must make sure I have what I need first. Instead, I look at my lack, give to those that are in need, and go back to my heavenly Father for the replenishing of my need. With resources like that, I can give to anyone that comes my way.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus is giving us insight into why the Law was given. First, it should give us a new perspective of the goodness and graciousness of the love of God for man. That should cause us to love Him in return. Then, it tells us how to live with our fellow man with concern and love. Rebellion (sin) says we are not our brother's keeper. It says we are only to look after self. The spirit of the Law is loving concern for those in need. Are you walking in the Spirit?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Do you see how all-sufficient your heavenly Father is so that you can be generous to those He brings your way?</p>
