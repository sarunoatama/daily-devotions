<p>Isaiah 26:3 (NIV) <i><sup>3</sup>You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in you.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Isaiah spent the previous chapters telling of all the destruction that was to come to Judah and the surrounding nations. Then he looked forward in time to when the nation of God's people will enter their holy city. The walls and ramparts are salvation. God wipes away every tear from their eyes. It is the nation of believers who will not forsake their faith in God.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of that faith, God keeps them in perfect peace. The world goes through changes and turmoil. Nations rise and fall. So much of our sense of security is in the flimsiest of things, but those whose minds are steadfast, seeing the sovereignty of God, and the love and faithfulness of God, are kept in perfect peace. Perfect peace is not circumstantial. It is much deeper than passing things. They trust that God never changes. They trust that the love that He has shown them and His faithfulness and mercy will continue forever. There is no fear that He will ever change.</p>
<p class="indent">All else is fluid. All else is undependable. But the eye of faith looks past this passing world and sees the unchanging God. The peace that brings is perfect. It is deep and abiding. It is the peace He gives us. Do you know this peace? Where is your trust placed? If it is on some temporal thing, turn away from that today and learn to trust in the unchanging One.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Do you possess His peace?</p>
