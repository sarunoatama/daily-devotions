<p>Habakkuk 3:17-19a (NIV) <i><sup>17</sup>Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, <sup>18</sup>yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior. <sup>19a</sup>The Sovereign LORD is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to go on the heights.</i></p>

<p class="indent">JOY! It is not based on any circumstance in the physical world. That reactive happiness is fleeting at best. It is a shallow joy that knows no depth or duration. The prophet knew that the judgments of God were going to fall on his nation because of their rebellion against God. He declared that it would not affect his joy. He rejoiced in the LORD, Jehovah, the unchanging One. Though the world changes constantly, Habakkuk found reason to rejoice in the unchanging God. He knew the character of God was faithful and true, always loving and yet righteous. He would be joyful in God, his Savior, regardless of circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you really know this type of joy, or is your joy the shallow joy of circumstance? Do you know the greatness of the God who has said He will never leave you or forsake you? Can you rejoice in the love that will never change, and be joyful in the God who has saved you from sin and the wrath to come?</p>
<p class="indent">In the last verse Habakkuk declared the Sovereign LORD as his strength. He didn't trust in his own ability, but in the endless resources of his God who rules over the affairs of men. He closed his prophecy with a declaration of where he finds his joy. <i>"He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to go on the heights." </i>Others may wallow in the world below, but God enables me to run with Him on the high places, far above worldly concerns.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Do you let the LORD enable you to run on the heights with Him? It is not escaping. It is putting things in their proper perspective.</p>
