<p>1 Samuel 30:22-24 (NIV) <i><sup>22</sup>But all the evil men and troublemakers among David's followers said, "Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go." <sup>23</sup>David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and handed over to us the forces that came against us. <sup>24</sup>Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike."</i></p>

<p class="indent">David and his men returned from a predicament of marching with the Philistines against Judah. The commanders of the Philistines feared David would turn on them so they sent them back before the battle. Delivered from that situation, they came home to find their city burned and their families taken captive. David didn't act without consulting the LORD. The LORD sent him against the Amalekites that had burned their city. It is interesting that Saul lost the kingdom over sparing the Amalekites, while David is about to come into power after a battle with them.</p>
<p class="indent">They had marched so long that one-third of David's men could not go on. Two-thirds marched on and fought for 24 straight hours, recapturing everything and taking a huge amount of spoil. On returning to the others, some did not want to share the spoils of war. David had the right perspective. He insisted the victory was from God and so all had a right to the spoils. Those who stayed behind and took care of their home were as deserving as those who went into battle.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people think that missionaries and pastors will have all the heavenly rewards. They would not be where they are without the prayer and financial support of those who stay behind. The spoils will be shared by all. Even the angels in heaven rejoice over every soul that comes into the Kingdom.</p>
