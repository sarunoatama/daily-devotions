<p>Luke 1:46-49 (NIV) <i><sup>46</sup>And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord <sup>47</sup>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, <sup>48</sup>for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed, <sup>49</sup>for the Mighty One has done great things for me&#8211; holy is his name.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The angel Gabriel shared a secret with Mary. He told her that her cousin Elizabeth was six months pregnant. Mary, now pregnant herself, went to see her. As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's voice, the baby in her womb jumped. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke a word of revelation. She knew that Mary was the mother of her Lord! She told Mary she was blessed among women.</p>
<p class="indent">Then Mary uttered her song of praise. She acknowledged the blessing God had given her, the greatness of the miraculous conception. Then she added that God's name is holy. Yes! He is utterly apart from creation and yet He is imminently present. He is completely pure, and yet He even became physically present to redeem fallen man.</p>
<p class="indent">In the womb of Mary, tiny hands were forming. Those hands had designed Mary. They had set the earth in motion. They had thrown the stars in space. This was the miracle of all miracles, that God could become physically manifest. It was the greatest expression of love ever seen. It would culminate in the cross and ultimately resurrection. If you can accept this miracle, all the other miracles are only natural results of this one. Either this story is the greatest lie the world has ever known and Christmas is a total distortion of history, or God became a man to redeem you and me. If it is true, and the life of Jesus verified it, then we had better heed the words of the God who physically manifested Himself for our sake.</p>
<p class="indent">In a metaphoric way, the baby growing in Mary's womb is like Christ being formed in us. As time marches on, more and more of the life of Christ should be formed within us, until He is manifested in our lives.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Let that life in you be expressed in all His fullness.</p>
