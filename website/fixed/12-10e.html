<p>2 Peter 1:20-21 (NIV) <i><sup>20</sup>Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation. <sup>21</sup>For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Scriptures are not just the ideas of man. They did not originate in the will of man. There was a much greater power guiding and carrying their speech and writings. The world would call them inspired. That literally means breathed into. In this passage we have more of a sense of being picked up by a hurricane and carried. Certainly there was the personality of the prophet involved, but the hand of the omnipotent God was moving his thought and speech. It was not that they were robots without a will, but neither did the ideas and words originate in them.</p>
<p class="indent">God works in the same way with us today. He uses the personality that He designed to fit into the purpose for which He created us. We think we came up with a wonderful idea, but all along it was planned before we were created. The Spirit of God carries us into places of ministry and divine encounters that we might think had their origin in our will, but were always a part of His marvelous plan.</p>
<p class="indent">Keep your eyes open to the wonderful workings of God in your life. Realize that He is intricately involved in the details of your life. When something amazing happens, know that He planned it before He created you. Rejoice in the wonderful plans He prepared in advance for you.</p>
