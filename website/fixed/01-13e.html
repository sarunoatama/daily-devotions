<p>Zephaniah 3:17 (NIV) <i><sup>17</sup>The LORD your God is with you, he is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, he will quiet you with his love, he will rejoice over you with singing."</i></p>

<p class="indent">There is a need within the heart of man to be appreciated and valued. That is why the one requirement God places on a wife is to respect her husband and for the husband to love his wife. We desperately need that respect.</p>
<p class="indent">Though these words were spoken from God to the Jewish people, all of God's children can claim them. In Christ, we are His children, and God is delighted with us. Imagine that! Just like you are delighted with your children, or someone who is very dear to you, God delights in us. Your parents probably took great delight in you when you accomplished something. God takes great delight in you because Jesus accomplished something for you and you accepted it. When God sees you, He sees the accomplishments of Jesus. Think how delighted that makes His heart.</p>
<p class="indent">He is so delighted in you that He breaks out in song. Have you ever done that? Were you so delighted in someone you loved that you threw together a song that just came bubbling up from your heart? Think on God feeling that way about you! Whenever we feel unappreciated, a lack of respect and a lack of value placed on who we are, we need to remember these words. Of all those we could be valued by, wouldn't you most want God to value you? He does. That should still our hearts.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Do I value my great God like He values me? When was the last time I erupted into a song of joy for who He is?</p>
