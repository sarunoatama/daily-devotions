<p>2 Corinthians 5:15-17 (NIV) <i><sup>15</sup>And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again. <sup>16</sup>So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. <sup>17</sup>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!</i></p>

<p class="indent">Paul declared that it was the love of Christ that motivated and directed him. He no longer lived for himself but for the One who died for him and was raised again. He declared that this should be the normal Christian life. We should all be living for the One who died for us, not for self.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you see others with eternal significance or temporary influence? I believe Paul is saying that, at first, the disciples did not understand that Jesus was their Creator. They thought of Him only as a potential Messiah that would set up an earthly kingdom. Are we looking at people in the same way? Do we see them as what potential they have to do something for us, how they can help us achieve temporal goals? Or do we see others as the sons and daughters of God that He has called them to be?</p>
<p class="indent">What a change this would make in the way we relate to one another! Instead of making decisions as to what is temporarily good for us, we should make them on what is good for the growth and development of the new creation that they are. That is living for Christ. That is making the decisions on the basis of what is good for the Kingdom of God. Our brothers and sisters are no longer pawns of the enemy, but have become royalty. We should treat one another that way.</p>
<p class="indent">Do our eyes of faith see what God is making of one another? If so, we can love one another with His love. We can be patient and bear with the passing weaknesses, knowing that they are patiently bearing with us. The work that God has begun will be completed. Look past the transitory and see the finished work. God does when He looks at you, and aren't you glad!</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Do unto others as you would have them do to you.</p>
