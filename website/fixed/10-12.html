<p>Psalms 51:4-6 (NIV) <i><sup>4</sup>Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge. <sup>5</sup>Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. <sup>6</sup>Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place.</i></p>

<p class="indent">When the prophet Nathan exposed King David's sin with a parable, David wrote this psalm of repentance. He realized that though he had sinned against Bathsheba's husband and the people of Israel, ultimately his sin was against God who had trusted him with position and authority. All sin is ultimately a sin against God who alone is the standard of righteousness. We sin against His goodness and grace. We sin against His mercy and love. Whenever His sentence is against us, He is perfectly justified in pronouncing it.</p>
<p class="indent">David declared that he was sinful from the time he was born. Unlike modern philosophy, David knew sin was in his very nature, inherited from Adam. Even from conception, rebellion against God was the driving force of his character. We want to believe that children are born innocent, but you never have to teach them to be selfish and rebel. It is in their nature, as it is in ours. We need a Redeemer. We need a Deliverer.</p>
<p class="indent">It is God that teaches us truth in our mind and spirit. He shows us what is evil and cuts through all our justifications. His Spirit is the One who imparts wisdom. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom. To recognize that God is just and will deal with sin, the inherited sin nature, and the sinful acts we yield to, gives us a healthy fear of God. Wisdom teaches us to come to God for cleansing for our actions and for who we are by nature. We are sinful from birth. Only God can change our nature. Are you a new creation in Christ Jesus? Have you accepted His sacrifice for who you are and for what you do?</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: The only appropriate response to such generosity is to make Him your Lord and God.</p>
