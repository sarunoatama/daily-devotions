<p>Judges 6:12,16 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, "The LORD is with you, mighty warrior."</i></p>
<p><i><sup>16</sup>The LORD answered, "I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites together."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Just as God had promised, oppressors came to afflict Israel when they began to worship other gods. The oppression was so severe and the oppressors so ruthless that they had to hide food in caves so they could survive. Then they began to call out to the true God.</p>
<p class="indent">The angel of the LORD is Jesus. You will notice He is later called LORD (JHWH). Jesus is the manifestation of God (Colossians 1:15). Jesus declared He was with Gideon and called him a mighty warrior. Gideon was hiding in a wine press to thresh his grain and yet the Lord called him a mighty warrior. God sees what He is making us into. What does the LORD call you?</p>
<p class="indent">Gideon is not so sure it is the LORD. If he is to take on this challenge to rally Israel, he knows he must have the LORD with him. The LORD promised to be with him, just as He has promised to be with us (Matthew 28:20). Whatever God asks us to do He will equip and help us accomplish it. He calls us to be co-laborers, not lone rangers.</p>
<p class="indent">Gideon had his doubts and needed to be sure. The LORD allowed Gideon to bring an offering. He then caused fire to come from the rock and consume the food Gideon had brought. God will assure us of His will and confirm that He is with us to help us accomplish the tasks He gives us.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: What does the Lord call you? If He is with you, He will bring it to pass.</p>
