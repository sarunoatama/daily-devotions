<p>Nehemiah 12:44, 46-47 (NIV) <i><sup>44</sup>At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites... <sup>46</sup>For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. <sup>47</sup>So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The wall was finished and the people had made an oath to be faithful to God. Now was the time to rejoice. They took a break during their repentance to celebrate the feast of booths, remembering what God had done. Now, after hearing the Law read and making an oath to keep it, they were celebrating God's current mercy and favor. We need to remember God's favor shown us in the past as well as His present mercy and goodness.</p>
<p class="indent">The leaders of Judah and two large choirs marched around the top of the walls of Jerusalem going in opposite directions, singing praise and thanksgiving to God. They celebrated joyfully. Our services of worship should include these times of joyful worship for present victories.</p>
<p class="indent">The people were pleased with the ministry of the priests and Levites, so they brought their firstfruits and tithes. When houses of worship minister according to the Word of the Lord, there should be sufficient offerings without coaxing the people to give.</p>
<p class="indent">Everyone was in their assigned place of service as God had intended. Directors of music and the singers, the gatekeepers and Levites who took care of the House of God, all received a portion from the tithes so that they could focus on ministering to the LORD. We think of ministry to the people, but we forget about ministry to the LORD. In our present day, this is being revived in places as songs of praise and worship are sung around the clock.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: What is your ministry to the LORD? How can we see that ministry to the Lord continues?</p>
