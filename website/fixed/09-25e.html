<p>Ephesians 1:13-14 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, <sup>14</sup>who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession&#8211;to the praise of his glory.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Every spiritual blessing is ours in Christ Jesus! (Ephesians 1:3) Being in Christ, having hidden our life in His, and being clothed with Him, means that God sees Jesus when He looks at you. We get included in on all the good things that Christ deserves. Salvation is being included in Christ, being a part of His body. That affects us in so many ways. When we accepted the word of truth, we became included in Him. Are you continuing to remain in Him? (John 15:4-6)</p>
<p class="indent">When you believed and were included in Christ, you were marked with a seal. Just like a wax seal stamped with a signet shows that what is inside is from the bearer of the signet, so the outer you should reflect Christ to the extent that others know that what is on the inside is from the Lord. Only the Holy Spirit can produce those fruits in you. When you sense those fruits of love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, kindness, and self-control, you can know that you belong to Jesus. You are assured that you are truly saved. Perhaps someone is yelling at you, and you are able to stay in control and even find compassion for him or her. Or maybe circumstances all seem to be against you and yet you are experiencing peace and joy. You are experiencing the deposit.</p>
<p class="indent">The word that is used here is very similar to how we would use the term "down payment". It means we have a portion of what we will one day receive. Every believer has a deposit. It is our guarantee. It tells us one day our bodies will by redeemed, changed, transformed, and we will be able to receive the full amount. As much as you have experienced the Spirit of God, you haven't tasted but a small portion. We are God's possession. His plan is that we be to the praise of His glory.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: He takes the lowliest thing and transforms it into a thing that displays the wonder of His ability. Are you ready?</p>
