<p>Hebrews 2:9-11 (NIV) <i><sup>9</sup>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. <sup>10</sup>In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering. <sup>11</sup>Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus humbled Himself to become a man, setting aside His glory, to be one of us. Because He took the punishment of sin in our place, tasting death for everyone, God crowned Him with glory and honor. That should reveal to us the great heart of God who was willing to give His only Son, but also that He honors those who sacrifice for the good of others. Jesus sacrificed His life for the purpose of bringing many sons to glory. He left His glory so that He could bring you to glory.</p>
<p class="indent">The author of Hebrews often used nautical terms. There is an unusual one here in this passage. When a ship ran aground, the strongest, most capable swimmer was chosen to take a rope from the ship to the safety of the shore and secure it. The sailors could then cling to the rope and not be swept away by the current as they made their way to the safety of the shore. It is translated "author" here. You could also use the word "trailblazer". Jesus secured a line of safety for us to reach God.</p>
<p class="indent">He is our perfect Savior because He suffered all the things we suffer. He got in the boat with us and endured the storms of life with us. None of us could ever hope to make it to the safety of shore. Knowing that the boat of humanity had run aground and was about to be beaten to pieces, He joined our boat and suffered with us. He dove in and braved the currents and secured the rope to within the Holy of Holies in heaven. As we escape this storm we are brought right into the very presence of God, accepted in Christ, who became one of us.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: He is our perfect trailblazer. He can show us the Way because He walked (swam) it for us.</p>
