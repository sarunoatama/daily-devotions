<p>Genesis 3:1 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"</i></p>

<p class="indent">That ol' serpent, the Devil, is the craftiest of all the creatures God has made. But the Scriptures tell us we are not ignorant of his devices. We see several of them right here in his first attack on mankind. First, he went to the woman. The authority over the woman was to be the man. She was made to assist the man. The enemy of our souls never goes to the proper authority. He challenges legitimate authority.</p>
<p class="indent">See him challenging what God has said. <i>"Did God really say...?"</i> as if you misunderstood God. In most cases, our first impression of what God said is absolutely correct. When we get down to examining the words to twist them, to get our way, we are headed in the Devil's direction. What was your first impression of what God said? Then don't mess with it to satisfy your desires!</p>
<p class="indent">Satan always sees the glass half-empty. Here they are in a garden in which every need is supplied. If anyone ever had every need met, it was Eve. Satan always points to something you supposedly don't have. Child of God, in Jesus you lack no good thing. If you don't have it, you don't need it, or God will give it to you in His perfect time. Satan's picture of God is always the opposite of who He really is. Satan would paint God to be a miserly, selfish, demanding taskmaster when in reality He is the opposite of all those things. You see, Satan's goal is to make you think God is like him. Subversion of authority, distortion of His Word, and dissatisfaction with God's character and provision in your life are Satan's first lines of attack. Don't fall for it.</p>
