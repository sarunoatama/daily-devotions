<p>1 John 1:1-2, 5 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched&#8211;this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. <sup>2</sup>The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>5</sup>This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.</i></p>

<p class="indent">John was writing decades after he saw Jesus ascend into heaven. During that time, strange beliefs and theories about Jesus had sprung up. One of them was the thought that Jesus was not a physical being, but an apparition. John knew it was important for Christians to understand that Jesus became a man. They heard Him with their ears, saw Him with their eyes, and touched Him with their hands. He was the Word of life made flesh.</p>
<p class="indent">He was forever with God. He is Eternal Life. He was manifested so that we could know the love of God. It is important to understand that as a man, He took back what Adam gave up in the Garden. By living a perfect life, He became the perfect sacrifice who could take our sins because He had none of His own to die for. The Seed of the woman crushed the authority of Satan and took back dominion over the earth.</p>
<p class="indent">God is light! He does not have some hidden darkness within His character. There are no secret attributes that would make us shudder. There is absolutely nothing of darkness in Him. He is utterly holy. He is love. He has nothing to hide. What a God! It is not possible to imagine a more perfect God.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: God, in all His perfection, became a human being, in order that you could enter the Light of Eternal Life. Let Him purge all darkness from your life as you enter into Him.</p>
