<p>Genesis 16:11-13 (NIV) <i><sup>11</sup>The angel of the LORD also said to her: "You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard of your misery. <sup>12</sup>He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers." <sup>13</sup>She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen the One who sees me."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Hagar had been abused. She left her security because she would rather take a chance at running away, even if it meant the risk of death. Things must have been pretty bad. There she was in the desert thinking that no one cared, that no one heard her heart. Jesus met her in her hour of need. Yes, the angel of the LORD is Jesus. He told her she had a son in her womb and to name him 'God hears', Ishmael. God heard her misery. She is not the one that was chosen to carry the Seed, but God heard her misery. He hears us in our most desperate circumstances. We may think no one else understands, but the angel of the LORD does. He hears our misery.</p>
<p class="indent">The sons of Ishmael have fulfilled verse 12. Then she said to the LORD who was speaking to her (notice the angel of the LORD and LORD are used synonymously) <i>"You are the God who sees me...".</i> Not only does God hear our misery, but He also sees our circumstances. He cares. God sent her back to Sarah, and she was able to go. Now she knew God saw and heard, and that was enough. It should be enough for whatever circumstance we face too. He sees and He hears. Know that He is with you and understands like no one else can. You do have One to Whom you can turn. He has heard and seen all you have been through. "No one ever cared for me like Jesus."</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: The Lord hears my misery and cares. He comforts those that mourn.</p>
