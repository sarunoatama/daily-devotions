<p>1 Samuel 23:16-17 (NIV) <i><sup>16</sup>And Saul's son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God. <sup>17</sup>"Don't be afraid," he said. "My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this."</i></p>

<p class="indent">David was going through a difficult time in his life. He had done nothing wrong or even with any impure motives, yet King Saul was hunting him down to kill him. Not only had he done nothing wrong, but he had been a faithful servant of the king, one of the best. He had fought the King's battles and soothed him when he was troubled. He was the King's son-in-law. There was no explanation but jealousy. David never said an evil word toward the King in response to all the evil the King intended upon David.</p>
<p class="indent">After some time of being an exile, David was discouraged. Jonathan had made a covenant of friendship with David. He risked his own standing to go out and find and encourage David. He helped him find strength in God. This is the best thing you can do for your discouraged friends. Help them find strength in God. He is the source of any genuine strength to endure.</p>
<p class="indent">Jonathan gave him the often-repeated Biblical message, "Do not be afraid." Many times we think all our effort is in vain. If you are being obedient to God, it is never in vain. God will see you through. Your enemies will not triumph in the end. Jonathan told David of his convictions that one-day David would reign. He could sense it was to be. Perhaps you have a discouraged friend who needs help to find strength in God. You can encourage them not to fear. You can encourage them with what you see coming in their lives. They need to look forward to what God is doing and not get bogged down in the present turmoil.</p>
