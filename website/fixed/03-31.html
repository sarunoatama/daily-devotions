<p>Deuteronomy 9:6 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Need some humble pie? Try this verse! We get things backward today, thinking we have been so good that God has to bless us. Wrong! All our righteousness is like filthy rags. If we were not blessed we would be whining complaining, and possibly even forsaking God. He only gives us what we can bear, and for some of us that is not very much. They are mature souls, those that have a heart to learn from God, that endure many trials. The more willing you are to learn, the more difficulty comes your way to teach you. Along with the difficulty comes great grace.</p>
<p class="indent">Never get to thinking the blessings are because of your goodness. If there is any goodness in your life, it is from the working of the Holy Spirit, the goodness of God. Now, if you should yield to His Spirit, and learn and grow so that you demonstrate the fruits of the Spirit, does God owe you blessings? No way! That is merely your duty, your responsibility as a creature. God owes you nothing. If He chooses to bless you it is either because you need a break before more instruction comes your way, or you are just too wimpy to take anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Stiff-necked, what an expression! When God calls, our heads do not turn. We go our own way ignoring Him. This is the nature of fallen man.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Thank God for every blessing and realize it comes from His generous Spirit. Thank Him for the trials too, because they come from the same Spirit.</p>
