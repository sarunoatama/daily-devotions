<p>Psalms 40:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require. <sup>7</sup>Then I said, "Here I am, I have come&#8211; it is written about me in the scroll. <sup>8</sup>I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."</i></p>

<p class="indent">The author of Hebrews quotes this passage and tells us it is about Jesus. He was reading the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the original Hebrew. There is a variation there, possibly a mistranslation in that Greek version. Instead of <i>"but my ears you have pierced"</i> it reads, <i>"but a body you prepared for me"</i> (Hebrews 10:5 (NIV)). Could it be a mistake? I believe every passage is inspired by God and that both expressions are true. The Son of God was given a human body through the womb of Mary. His ears were opened to God. In the tradition of a servant who chose to continue as a slave after his term of service was up, Jesus was a bondservant to the Father. The sign of the bondservant was the pierced ear. Both versions are applicable to Jesus.</p>
<p class="indent">The sacrifices the Jews made at the altar every morning and evening were merely a shadow of The Lamb to come. They were never what God desired for a covering of sin. Then the Son said to the Father, "Here I am, I have come." The Lamb of God came into the world to be the sacrifice God desired to take away the sins of the world. It was prophesied throughout the Old Testament. Jesus said He had come to do the will of God. That is the expression of a bondservant. He came to do the will of the Father in shedding His blood for our sins. The Law of God was in His heart. He knew His objective because the Law outlined it clearly, "Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin". God told the people of Israel He wanted to make them a nation of priests. There was only one way to do it. The heart of Jesus knew that He had to crush the head of the serpent but that in the process His heel would be wounded. Thank God! The Son desired to do the will of the Father for our salvation.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: You had a body prepared for you also. Is your ear open to God? Is it pierced as the sign of a bondservant? Do you delight to do His will? Is His Law in your heart?</p>
