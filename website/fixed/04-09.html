<p>Deuteronomy 17:18-20a (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the priests, who are Levites. <sup>19</sup>It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the LORD his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees <sup>20</sup>and not consider himself better than his brothers and turn from the law to the right or to the left.</i></p>

<p class="indent">God did not intend for the people to choose a king, but He knew they would. That is why He gave them guidelines for this king to follow. The first was that the LORD pick the man, not the people. There were other guidelines for the king, but the one quoted above stands out. The king was to have a personal copy of the Law. In other words, he needs to have his own copy of the Bible. It is suppose to be with him, not just somewhere in the palace. It is suppose to be read every day by the king.</p>
<p class="indent">The reason God asks for this to be done is spelled out for us. It is so the king will revere God. When we read of God's instruction, of His character, of His awesome works, we should respond with reverence for God. How was the king to lead His people in the ways of God if he did not read them himself? He was not to consider himself above the law, but subject to it like everyone else.</p>
<p class="indent">In Christ, God has made us kings and priests to Himself according to Revelation 1:6. Since God calls us kings, we need to do the same as the kings of old. Keep a copy of the Word. Read it daily. Revere God and follow carefully the words written there. Don't think the word does not apply to you as well.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: If you apply it to others, it applies to you.</p>
