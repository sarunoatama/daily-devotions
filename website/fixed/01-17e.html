<p>Zechariah 4:6-7 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>So he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the LORD Almighty. <sup>7</sup>"What are you, O mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of 'God bless it! God bless it!'"</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Zerubbabel was concerned that he will not be able to finish the work the Lord had called him to do. The obstacles before him seemed like a mountain that had to be moved. There were political enemies, threats of physical violence, and the people who were doing the work had their own concerns for family and safety. Then the angel of the LORD conveyed a message from the LORD to Zerubbabel. It is not by might or power, but by the Spirit of the LORD that things are accomplished. What a relief those words must have been to him. The message went on to say that the mountain of obstacles would become level ground. He would bring out the final finishing stone while the people shout blessings on the finished Temple.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of you reading this devotional probably look at your church and see a mountain that must be moved before it can be the church God wants it to be. How in the world will you get from here to there? It is not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the LORD. Man often intervenes with his power and might and ends up making a bigger mountain. Ask the LORD to do it by His Spirit. Act only at His leading. You will bring out that capstone with the people shouting, "God bless it!"</p>
<p class="indent">Certainly all of us look at the temple of our body and wonder if the work of sanctification will ever be completed. The mountain seems too big. Do you think, "Maybe if I try harder. Maybe if I use this discipline or that program?" <i>It is not by might...</i> Just cooperate with the Spirit of God living in you.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Commune with Him and cooperate with His leading, and He will finish the work He started in you as the saints and angels cry, "God bless you!" (1 John 3:2)</p>
