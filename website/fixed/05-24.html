<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>May 24</h1>
<p>1 Samuel 24:5-7 (NIV) <i><sup>5</sup>Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. <sup>6</sup>He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the LORD." <sup>7</sup>With these words David rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.</i></p>

<p class="indent">After all that Saul had done to David, trying to kill him with a javelin three times, promising one wife and not delivering, giving away his wife to another, and having David's priestly friends killed, David will not do a thing against him. In fact, just cutting off the corner of his robe caused his conscience to be stricken. He recognized Saul as the one on whom the anointing of God had been placed. Even though the anointing is on David now, he still respects Saul. Perhaps David realizes that what he does to Saul will set an example for others' behavior toward him in the future.</p>
<p class="indent">Every one of your brothers and sisters in Christ has been anointed. Do you treat them with as much respect and fear of the LORD as David did with Saul? It is no different. We are given opportunities to slander our brother, even speak the truth that would damage their reputation. Are you convicted to take even a corner from their robe so to speak? Has any of them done even half the wrongs that Saul did toward David? No? Then consider the example of David here. Remember your brother or sister has the anointing just as you do. They may be sidetracked, but that is for God to deal with. They may be in your hand, so to speak, but that is a test for you. Will you come away with a testimony like David's? His action and words were a rebuke to his soldiers.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are others convicted by my words and actions of respect for God's children?</p>
