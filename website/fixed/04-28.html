<p>Joshua 14:13-14 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance. <sup>14</sup>So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the LORD, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Caleb reminisced about spying out the Promised Land some 45 years earlier with Joshua. He reminded Joshua about how faithful he was to report that they could take the land because he had godly convictions. Then he reminded Joshua about the promise Moses had made to him. He could have whatever land he walked on. Caleb picked the Hebron area. There were still fortified cities with giants in them, but Caleb knew the LORD was with him. He felt as strong at 85 as he did at 40.</p>
<p class="indent">Joshua blessed Caleb and honored Moses promise, because Caleb wholeheartedly followed the God of Israel. It sounds like Caleb was going to take the area with his own clan, without the assistance of the other tribes. What a guy! 85 and he's ready to take on giants and start a new homestead.</p>
<p class="indent">What was Caleb's secret? He wholeheartedly followed the God of Israel. He stuck with his convictions in spite of what the majority said. He did not fear but recognized the hand of God was with him, no rationalization, no justification, just convictions backed up by action.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you have a spirit like Caleb's? Why not? He wasn't born with it. It was instilled in him, because he was willing.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: The LORD rewards those who follow Him with their whole heart.</p>
