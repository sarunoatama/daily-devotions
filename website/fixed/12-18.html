<p>Jeremiah 30:21-22 (NIV) <i><sup>21</sup>Their leader will be one of their own; their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near and he will come close to me, for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me?' declares the LORD. <sup>22</sup>"'So you will be my people, and I will be your God.'"</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>"He came unto His own, and His own received Him not."</i> John 1:10 (KJV) In the promises of restoration, there are a number of prophecies concerning the coming Messiah. In this one, the Messiah is prophesied to rise from among them. He would not land in a spaceship or come from another land, neither would He be another type of creation. He would be an Israelite human. But what is it that makes Him different?</p>
<p class="indent">God says that the He will draw the Messiah near; He will come close. God draws us all near. The great difference is the Messiah never resisted the closeness of God. He yielded every time and came near. He devoted Himself to be close to His Father. Because of that, the church was born. That is how we became His people. Jesus' obedience, even unto death, made a way for us to be the people of God. He made it possible for God to be our God. <i>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the power to become the sons of God."</i> John 1:12 (KJV)</p>
<p class="indent">He also made it possible for the promise of the Father to be poured out, the Holy Spirit. Now we, too, can draw near to God. But it is our choice! Will we draw close? Will we devote ourselves to be close to Him? How much time will we spend in communion with Him in prayer and the Word? You can see those that do. They are easily distinguishable by their passion and love for God. In a life changing way, God has become their God.</p>
