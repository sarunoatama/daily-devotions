<p>Mark 9:22-24 (NIV) <i><sup>22</sup>"It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us." <sup>23</sup>"'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes." <sup>24</sup>Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus came upon His disciples and found them arguing. The issue at hand was a young boy who was possessed by a spirit. The father explained that he had brought the boy to Jesus' disciples but they could not cast it out. As soon as the spirit saw Jesus it threw the boy onto the ground causing him to roll around and foam at the mouth. We would diagnose this as an epileptic seizure. There is one clue that something more is taking place. The father told Jesus that the spirit often cast the boy into fire or water to kill him. Who does that kind of work? The Destroyer! The thief has come to kill, steal, and destroy. People often blame tragedy upon God when it is the work of the evil one. Those signs, destruction, theft, and death, are his calling cards.</p>
<p class="indent">The man asked Jesus to heal the boy if He could. Jesus picked up on his wording, "If you can". Jesus believes completely in the Father. The man realized what Jesus was saying but acknowledged his human weakness. <i>"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</i> We can surely relate to that expression. We believe by the grace of God, but there remains in our flesh some unbelief. We desire the help of God to overcome that unbelief. We acknowledge that without the Spirit's help we will never overcome it. This honest assessment brought the miracle the man desired. The son was delivered from the evil spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">When you are faced with the need for a miracle, when the enemy comes in like a flood, be honest with your Savior. Tell Him about your struggle with unbelief, and ask for His help to overcome it. Do you think the miracle helped the man overcome his unbelief? It most assuredly did! When God meets your honesty with a miraculous resolution, allow that to help you overcome unbelief.</p>
