<p>Exodus 4:22-23 (NIV) <i><sup>22</sup>Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son, <sup>23</sup>and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"</i></p>

<p class="indent">Egypt is a picture of the world. Pharaoh is like the prince of this world, Satan. Those who are called of God are born into the world and are under its dominion. But when the LORD calls them out, the prince of this world will not readily let them go. He desires their servitude. He wants their worship and abhors the thought of them worshipping the LORD. His answer is always, "I will not let my slaves go."</p>
<p class="indent">The LORD calls those He will deliver His firstborn. He claims them as His own children. The firstborn have rights and privileges as heirs of their father. The Father calls us out of the world to worship Him. We have been serving Pharaoh, but we are to serve him no more. Now we are to come out from the world (2 Corinthians 6:17) and worship God.</p>
<p class="indent">The very strange thing is that some consider the constant grind of that master, sin, to be a thing of pleasure. The quota of bricks is always increased and we have to gather the straw on our own, but we still prefer Egypt (the world). We are so driven that we find no time to worship the LORD. The subtle Serpent has deceived us into thinking slavery is a good thing. He points to the things that fill our senses, the leeks and garlic, and says the servitude is worth it. It is death (Romans 6:23). The quota will be increased until the taskmasters work us to death.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus is the Great Deliverer. He has come to free you from slavery to the world, so that you can worship Him.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Have you come out and begun to worship, or do you find yourself so driven that you have no time to worship?</p>
