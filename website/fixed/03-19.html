<p>Deuteronomy 4:9 (NIV) <i><sup>9</sup>Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them slip from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Israel had seen so much since the days when Moses began to confront Pharaoh. If they could just remember all God had done and the lessons that He had taught them. If their children could only learn those stories by vivid story telling, so that they would cling to the lessons. What a difference it would make in their future and the choices they would make! It would save them from such heartache and sorrow.</p>
<p class="indent">They were warned to be careful and watch themselves closely so as not to forget, letting the lessons slip from their heart. We have the same warning in the New Testament. Hebrews 2:1 (NIV)<i>We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. </i>And how much more it applies to us who know all that God did to provide us the Way of salvation in His only Son?</p>
<p class="indent">We need to teach our children the lessons of the Word as well as those from our own lives. We need to remember the testimonies of when God met us and share them with our children. We need to share the wonder of when the Word came alive to us and spoke to us personally. When we do that, we not only encourage their faith, but we set an example that will affect future generations. Never fear sharing your personal walk with God with your children. They need to hear about it. It also reminds you of the lessons you have learned and helps prevent them from slipping from your heart.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider setting aside a time to share with your children the things that the LORD has shown you.</p>
