<p>1 Chronicles 28:12, 19 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the LORD and all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things... <sup>19</sup>"All this," David said, "I have in writing from the hand of the LORD upon me, and he gave me understanding in all the details of the plan."</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">There is a tendency to think God was more visible and directly involved in Old Testament times in more dramatic ways than in this age. As David was sharing the plans of the Temple with Solomon, he told how he received the inspiration for the plan. He did not have a vision or experience some kind of autonomic writing. He did not have a vivid dream or spirit travel to heaven. The Spirit of God put it in his mind. The hand of the LORD was upon him and gave him understanding of the details of the plan.</p>
<p class="indent">The LORD often works with us in the same way. If (and that is a great big "IF") we are seeking Him and His will with all our heart and have been walking with Him for some time to learn discernment, the Spirit inspires our thoughts. As we walk with the hand of the LORD upon us, we will discern Spirit inspired thoughts.</p>
<p class="indent">Thoughts come from one of three sources: suggestions from the demonic, our own soul, or the Spirit of God. As we mature we learn to discern the difference and become more and more attentive and obedient to the Spirit inspired thoughts and quick to reject the enemy's temptations. When we pray we will notice the thoughts for whom to pray for enter our mind. As we approach daily difficulties, we will notice solutions that we had not thought of. Be careful to give God all the credit and the glory for those. That is what David was doing when he said, <i>"He gave me understanding in all the details of the plan."</i> "I can't take credit for one little detail. God inspired my thoughts." We find the same experience today as we go about working on the temple with living stones.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Grab those God inspired thoughts and give Him all the glory when you see the good fruit.</p>
