<p>1 Samuel 28:5-7 (NIV) <i><sup>5</sup>When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. <sup>6</sup>He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. <sup>7</sup>Saul then said to his attendants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her." "There is one in Endor," they said.</i></p>

<p class="indent">When man becomes unrepentant and justifies his flesh, he will abandon his standards to get what he wants. To the very end, Saul remained unrepentant and proud. Faced with a united army of the Philistines, and having banished David and his men, he began to fear the outcome of the approaching battle. In fear for his physical life, he inquired of God, but God wouldn't answer him.</p>
<p class="indent">It is interesting to note the usual ways in which the LORD did speak to him in the past. Dreams are one way in which the LORD communicates with us then and now. When we don't have the exact instruction in God's word, the LORD may reveal His direction in a dream. The Urim is believed to have been stones in the breastplate of the High Priest that would glow in answer to yes or no questions. Finally, the prophets are listed. A prophet would have a word from the LORD for Saul as Samuel had done in the past.</p>
<p class="indent">Saul had become the enemy of the LORD by disobedience and pride. He went against the Word of God in calling on a witch to bring up the spirit of Samuel. When we know we are out of God's will and that God is silent toward us, desperate people will try forbidden means to see the future. If God does not tell you, it is better for you not to know. Do not try to find out the secrets of God through mystical means. It only compounds the sin of rebellion against God. If you are not hearing from God, search out the issues in your heart that must change.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: If you aren't hearing God's instruction, the problem may be in your own heart.</p>
