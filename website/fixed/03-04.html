<p>Numbers 11:21-23 (NIV) <i><sup>21</sup>But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!' <sup>22</sup>Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?" <sup>23</sup>The LORD answered Moses, "Is the Lord's arm too short? You will now see whether or not what I say will come true for you."</i></p>

<p class="indent">The people were whining about not having meat to eat. Moses was very discouraged. God promised meat for a month along with some valuable lessons. Moses just couldn't see that it was possible. He looked out over the camp and couldn't imagine how God could do it. His response to God was an exaggeration. Certainly all the fish in the sea could have fed them. Even the flocks they drove before them could have fed them. When we are discouraged, even the practical looks impossible.</p>
<p class="indent">God's response is worth memorizing and keeping at hand when you think He has promised more than can be delivered. Has the omnipotent God lost some of His power? Can't the One who created the world and everything in it provide anything at anytime He chooses? Is any thing out of His reach? Don't limit the Eternal One! He can do whatever He says He will do in keeping with His perfect character.</p>
<p class="indent">This was going to be a lesson for Moses and for you and me. You and I have seen what God can do when we read these true stories. We have seen what He has done in the lives of people we know and in our own life. We have seen that God can do what we considered impossible. Never doubt God's capability to do what He has promised. He is able! You have seen it. You will see it again. Trust Him, and climb out of your pit of doubt up into the sunlight of faith.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Do I truly consider God capable of doing anything in keeping with His character?</p>
