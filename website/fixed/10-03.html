<p>Psalms 27:1, 4 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>The LORD is my light and my salvation&#8211; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life&#8211; of whom shall I be afraid?</i></p>
<p><i><sup>4</sup>One thing I ask of the LORD, this is what I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple.</i></p>

<p class="indent">David declared the LORD to be his light and his salvation. It was the presence of the LORD in his life that enabled him to see things as they really were, that kept him from stumbling in the darkness. It was the presence of the LORD in his life that saved him out of all his difficulties. The LORD was his salvation. He didn't lean on self to understand or to get him out of danger. He recognized that his help came from the LORD.</p>
<p class="indent">He goes on to say that men cannot make him afraid. If God is sovereign, and He has become my light and my salvation, what can man do to me? With the LORD as his stronghold, he always knew where to run for safety. Do you turn to God first in all your fears and concerns? Is He your light and salvation, the stronghold of your life? Without that, men will cause you to fear. Situations will overwhelm you. With that assurance, you will always know that the will of the God who loves you will be done. He will see you through anything men or demons can dish out.</p>
<p class="indent">And if you are called home, you will be in His presence forever. What is the worst man can do? Kill me? Then I will end up where I long to be, gazing upon the beauty of the LORD and seeking Him in His heavenly dwelling place. David may have been referring to the tabernacle, but I think his mind moved from the earthly to the reality in heaven. His great desire was to spend eternity gazing upon God. Somewhere in those years of shepherding or training under Saul, he must have had a vision of the beauty of God. That became the one thing his soul sought after. We need a vision like that so that He becomes our one thing. Then, if illness strikes, or men threaten, like the Apostle Paul, we can say, "To die is gain."</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Make the LORD your one thing.</p>
