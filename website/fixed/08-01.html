<p>1 Chronicles 29:14 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>"But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This final prayer of David reminds us of the Lord's prayer. It begins by acknowledging the greatness of God and praising His attributes. Take time to read the whole prayer in 1 Chronicles 29:10-20. David had given tons of gold and silver and piles of wood. Then the leaders gave in great abundance. They were humbled by how much wealth the LORD had given them. It was only 40 years earlier when the Philistine army was defeating them and taking their lands. Only recently had they survived the coup of Absalom. God had granted them so many blessings that they willingly gave for a house for His name.</p>
<p class="indent">David asked in the prayer, <i>"But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this?" </i>Why is God so gracious? David was not perfect. He sinned greatly, but he repented and was humbled. A fallen and restored man can more quickly acknowledge his unworthiness. The piles of materials dedicated to the temple reminded them how much God had blessed them in spite of their unworthiness.</p>
<p class="indent">Do we realize that all we give back to God is only what He has blessed us with in the first place? Does it humble us and cause us to be in awe of His great goodness when we consider how much we can give? Sadly, it often has the opposite effect of causing us to be boastful. That just shows our ignorance. How can we boast when we are only giving back what has been given to us? David was a humbled man who was still after God's heart. That is why his attitude and response were in touch with reality.</p>
