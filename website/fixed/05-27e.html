<p>John 1:17-18 (NIV) <i><sup>17</sup>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup>18</sup>No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Moses was the mediator of the Law. He was the One who went up the mountain and met with God. He brought down the Laws of God to guide the nation of Israel to the Messiah. The Law brought a realization of our failure to live up to God's standard. Through the Law, man could see how incapable he is and how dependent on God he must be.</p>
<p class="indent">When the Messiah came, He was the source of grace and truth. We see the grace and truth of God in His life. Moses brought the Law on tablets of stone. Jesus brought grace and truth in His very being. The life He lived and the words that He spoke were the grace and truth of God to man. Our requirement to meet God's standard is met in Jesus' life.</p>
<p class="indent">The only One who could ever convey to us who God is, the fullness of His truth and grace, is the One who has always been with God. No one else has truly seen God. Jesus has made God known to mankind. Every other man that has tried to convey the truth of God falls infinitely short of the revelation that Jesus demonstrated with His own life and words. Whatever mediator you choose to turn to, none can come close to the Revelation you see in the Gospels. Only Jesus can truly make God known to us.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have been looking to some other person, whether they are a Christian or not, realize that the revelation of God to your heart must be known personally through Jesus. At best, that other person can only point you to Him as I am attempting to do now. You must meet Him personally in the Gospels.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Jesus is the only One who can truly make God known to you.</p>
