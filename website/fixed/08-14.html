<p>2 Chronicles 24:2,5-6 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years of Jehoiada the priest... <sup>5</sup>He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, "Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now." But the Levites did not act at once. <sup>6</sup>Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, "Why haven't you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?"</i></p>

<p class="indent">It was really Jehoiada's love for God and faith in His promises that motivated him to risk his life to see that the throne was restored to the lineage of David. Being Joash's surrogate father, he had a great deal of influence on the king. Our passage today indicates that his influence kept Joash obedient to God as long as Jehoiada lived.</p>
<p class="indent">Joash, was probably a young teen when he ordered the collection of the temple tax. He wanted the temple repaired. Former Queen Athaliah had robbed the temple for the temple of Baal. When the priests were slow to obey the command, he called Jehoiada and asked him why he wasn't seeing that the Word of God was being lived up to. Now it is Jehoiada's turn to reap what he had sowed. He sowed the word into Joash's life and now Joash was requiring him to act on that word. For those who love the Lord, a challenge to obey is not a trial to bear. It is a blessing.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the ones we mentor can turn around and mentor us in areas we are blind to, or making excuses for. What better evidence could we have that our work in the LORD is being blessed and taking hold? Proverbs 12:1 tells us the man who hates correction is stupid. Proverbs 13:8 says the one who heeds it is honored.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Do you welcome the correction of others, even when they are someone you have taught?</p>
