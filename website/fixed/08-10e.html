<p>Romans 5:15-17 (NIV) <i><sup>15</sup>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! <sup>16</sup>Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. <sup>17</sup>For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.</i></p>

<p class="indent">It was because of Adam's sin that death entered the world. Death reigned over all men. All felt the conviction of God because of sin. They sensed that judgment was to follow. What a weight Adam brought upon mankind!</p>
<p class="indent">It only took one man to bring a gift of grace, God's grace, to liberate all that would come to Him for that gift. What contrasting elements these two brought into the world! The one brought death and the other life. But we are not just talking about man's last breath and life after death. Those are just a part of death and life. Death is the reign of sin over us. Its destructive ways demand that all that is done be lifeless and damaging to you and all involved with you. It is more than a lifestyle. It is a tyrant that chains you to self-destruction. It is a master at torture. It promises and never delivers. It is the craving for salt in a man dying of thirst.</p>
<p class="indent">In a similar but contrasting way, the gift of Jesus Christ is life reigning in you. If you have received the abundant provision of grace and the righteousness of Christ, then through Jesus Christ you live! That means that your daily life is a channel for His Spirit to bring life to you and to those your life touches. Instead of the destructiveness we once lived under, all that we do leads to lasting goodness and wholeness. Instead of sin reigning over your thoughts, actions and desires, Jesus reigns. His very life steers you toward all that is good as you grow into His likeness. Life is more than a heartbeat. It is the reign of the Giver of life.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Is He reigning in you today, or are you a slave of sin and death?</p>
