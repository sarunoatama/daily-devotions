<p>Matthew 19:24-26 (NIV) <i><sup>24</sup>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." <sup>25</sup>When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?" <sup>26</sup>Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</i></p>

<p class="indent">A rich young man approached Jesus. He inquired of Jesus which laws were necessary to keep to enter into heaven. Many Jews believed that if they could narrow down the laws to those most important to God, they would stand a better chance of getting into heaven. Jesus asked the man to sell all he owned, give it to the poor, and follow Him. This came at a time when Jesus only had about a week before the crucifixion.</p>
<p class="indent">The man went away sorrowful. Jesus had put His finger on the one thing that kept this young man from God. He trusted in his wealth. Then Jesus told the disciples something that astounded them, the camel and eye of the needle analogy. Some of the gates around Jerusalem were not of great height. To get a camel through, the baggage had to be taken off. The camel had to be pulled through on its knees. The picture is a forsaking of wealth and acceptance of humility. Jews thought wealth was a sign of God's blessing, so the disciples asked, "Who then can be saved?" It is the same for all men. It is not a keeping of the Law or any outward thing. It is the miraculous work of God.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Salvation is a work of God's grace. Nothing you can do will make God love you any more. However, clinging to the world may keep you from opening your hands to receive His grace.</p>
