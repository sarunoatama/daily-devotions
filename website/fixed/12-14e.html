<p>1 John 1:6-7, 9 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth. <sup>7</sup>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>9</sup>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.</i></p>

<p class="indent">God is light. There is no darkness in Him at all. If we claim to be in vital communication with God, and yet reserve an area of darkness for ourselves, we lie. We are not living in truth. God will not tolerate that darkness. It will have to go, or it will keep you from God.</p>
<p class="indent">When we give up those areas of darkness, we find we are free to share our lives with one another. We no longer have anything to hide. Jesus in our brothers and sisters challenged us to forsake the darkness. That is why we avoid being with them when we have those reservations. We make all kinds of excuses about their problems, but the real problem is that Jesus in them challenges us to give it all up.</p>
<p class="indent">In fellowship with the body of Christ, our lives are continually cleansed and transformed in an ever-increasing way. When we see that darkness has invaded our thoughts or desires, we should confess and forsake it. Then we experience forgiveness and increasing purification. You can know that God will always be faithful and just to honor what Jesus did for you on the cross. Don't fall for the condemnation of the enemy. Stay in fellowship with God and your spiritual family.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are you making excuses to avoid fellowship with the body of Christ? Whatever your excuse, it will not stand the litmus test of Scripture. Examine your own heart for areas of darkness. Walk in the light. Walk in fellowship with God and His family.</p>
