<p>Matthew 19:28-30 (NIV) <i><sup>28</sup>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <sup>29</sup>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. <sup>30</sup>But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.</i></p>

<p class="indent">After Jesus' exhortation to the rich young ruler, Peter asked what it meant for them to have left all to follow Jesus. First, Jesus promises the disciples places of authority in the coming kingdom. Then He addresses all who suffer loss for His sake. The promise is one hundred times more than what you left and eternal life! The eternal life part would be enough, but there is more. In the kingdom, people will receive a reward for their labor and their loss.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus sums it up by saying His kingdom is often opposite to that of the world. Many of the first will be last, and many who are last will be first. The upside down world of the kingdom promises to do right to those who have suffered loss. If you are following Jesus with your whole heart, you will experience this loss. It may be the forsaking of a career, a friendship, or physical assets. Whatever the loss from following Jesus, let your heart rest assured that one hundred times awaits you. You have sown the physical and you will reap one hundred times in the kingdom. The gospel of Mark adds that you will receive it in this age and in the age to come (Mark 10:30).</p>
