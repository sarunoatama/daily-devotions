<p>2 Samuel 19:21-22 (NIV) <i><sup>21</sup>Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, "Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the Lord's anointed." <sup>22</sup>David replied, "What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? This day you have become my adversaries! Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Do I not know that today I am king over Israel?"</i></p>

<p class="indent">When David fled Jerusalem, Shimei, who was from Saul's clan, threw stones at David and his men and cursed them. He declared that God had given the kingdom to David's son because of all the blood David had shed in the house of Saul. David was careful to shed no blood of the clan of Saul and executed those who did. One of David's guards wanted to kill Shimei. In humility, David said that perhaps the Lord had inspired the man to curse him.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon return to Jerusalem Shimei came to ask for forgiveness. Abishai, one of David's commanders, wanted him executed. David continued to have mercy on Shimei. He said he had the throne returned to him and that was enough. He also said he had nothing in common with Abishai. I believe David felt Shemei had a different attitude and spirit than Abishai. He was not vengeful and bitter, but merciful and forgiving as the Lord had been to him.</p>
<p class="indent">If we walk in the Lord, we will sometimes see our enemies ask for forgiveness. We will have opportunity to repay them with evil, but the Spirit of the Lord is to overcome evil with good. If we give in to that spirit of retribution, the enemy of our soul has won; he was behind the attacks in the first place. If the enemy of our soul can't get us when we are down, he'll try when we are on top.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Don't give in to a vengeful spirit. Be merciful and forgiving as the Lord has been to you.</p>
