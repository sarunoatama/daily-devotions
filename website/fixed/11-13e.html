<p>Hebrews 7:25-27 (NIV) <i><sup>25</sup>Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. <sup>26</sup>Such a high priest meets our need&#8211;one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. <sup>27</sup>Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The author of Hebrews was comparing the old order with the new. In the old, the priests had to come every day, morning and evening, to offer a sacrifice. At special times of the year there were additional sacrifices. On the Day of Atonement, one priest would take the blood of the lamb into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle it before the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
<p class="indent">All of that was a picture of the heavenly reality. Unlike the copy on earth, the heavenly priest, Jesus Christ, never dies. He serves forever. The blood He sprinkled before God was not that of animals, but His own. It is not as if He needs to present a sacrifice for Himself, for He is sinless. He doesn't have to do it over and over again, for His sacrifice was sufficient for all and for all time.</p>
<p class="indent">If anyone came to the high priest and had a sacrifice offered, he would soon have to come again with another because of his weakness. But Jesus' great sacrifice covered all sin for all time. When we come to Him and accept His sacrifice in our place, we do not need to come again and again. He saves completely all who come to God through Him. He lives to forever present the proof of our redemption.</p>
<p class="indent">Are you living in the conviction that all your sins have been dealt with? You should confess any that appear in your life today, but you should also know that they are dealt with already. There is no need for another sacrifice. There is no need to sprinkle more blood. Your holy, blameless, and pure Priest, who is exalted above the heavens, took care of it. Confess and repent, yes, but offer a sacrifice of praise for His finished work.</p>
