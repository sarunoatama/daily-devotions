<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>July 6</h1>
<p>John 16:31-33 (NIV) <i><sup>31</sup>"You believe at last!" Jesus answered. <sup>32</sup>"But a time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me. <sup>33</sup>"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."</i></p>

<p class="indent">The disciples had a difficult time understanding the analogies that Jesus used. During His last evening with them, they were struggling with His expression<i>, "in a little while you will see me no more and then in a little while you will see me."</i> Then Jesus told them that He would no longer use figures of speech and explained that He was going to return to the Father. Then they believed.</p>
<p class="indent">Yes, they now declared their belief, but to believe and to stake your life on that belief are two different things. Jesus warned them that their belief was not strong enough to keep them at His side. Though He would be alone, the Father would be with Him. As His disciples, we may have to walk that same road. In obedience to the Spirit, we may lose the company of those who have walked with us, but we will not be alone.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus was concerned for the turmoil they would experience during the coming days. If they knew He was returning they could have peace in Him. Even though the world is troubling and persecutes us, we know that He will return. Just as He returned to them, He will return to this earth in His glory.</p>
<p class="indent">Take heart! Be encouraged! The world will not continue on its present course forever. When He returns, the conquest He has already gained over the world will be manifested. He will share that conquest with us. His reign will be complete. Don't let the trouble of the world bring you down.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: You've read the final chapter! Have peace in Him.</p>
