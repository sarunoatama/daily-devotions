<p>2 Samuel 15:31-32 (NIV) <i><sup>31</sup>Now David had been told, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." So David prayed, "O LORD, turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness." <sup>32</sup>When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head.</i></p>

<p class="indent">As David abandoned Jerusalem, he covered his head and went barefoot to the top of the Mount of Olives. His counselor, Ahithophel, had gone over to Absalom's side. On the way up the Mountain he prayed that Ahithophel's counsel would be turned into foolishness.</p>
<p class="indent">As David reached the top, he saw Hushai. Hushai was one of David's counselors also. His torn clothing and dust on his head indicated his deep grief at what was happening. Being an elderly man, he could not travel quickly like David's men. David saw Hushai as an answer to his prayers. He sent Hushai back into Jerusalem to oppose the counsel of Ahithophel. It was a dangerous assignment, but he took it as a willing servant of the king.</p>
<p class="indent">Often we pray, and God immediately sends the answer. If we are not watching and expecting the answer to be sent, we will miss it. The answer to David's prayer was not as he might have imagined, neither is God's answer to many of our prayers. That is why we must be alert and attuned to the Spirit, expectantly looking for the answer. This prayer of David and God's immediate answer changed the course of the future and was a factor in the saving of his house and throne.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Don't miss God's answers to prayers prompted by the Holy Spirit.</p>
