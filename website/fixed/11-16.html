<p>Proverbs 30:4-5 (NIV) <i><sup>4</sup>Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered up the wind in the hollow of his hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in his cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and the name of his son? Tell me if you know! <sup>5</sup>"Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Who? The Word of God, the flawless One! He is the One who has ascended into heaven, but He first descended into the earth to be one of us. He gathers the wind in the hollow of His hands. The Spirit goes from Him and you hear His sound but only He knows where He is going. He is the One who has wrapped up the waters in His cloak. It is the washing of the water of the Word that prepares us to be the bride of Christ. He is the One who established the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="indent">What is His name? JHWH! And what is His Son's name? Jesus, the Christ, the one and only Son of God! Do you know His name? A thousand years before His birth God said, <i>"This day have I begotten Thee".</i> The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.</p>
<p class="indent">Have you let Him become your shield? What better shield than the One who made it all. Have you taken refuge in Him? What safer place could be found than the Almighty, who loves you and gave Himself for you? Trust in Him at all times. Pour out your heart before Him, the flawless One.</p>
