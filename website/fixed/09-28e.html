<p>Ephesians 2:19-21 (NIV) <i><sup>19</sup>Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household, <sup>20</sup>built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. <sup>21</sup>In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Paul explained to his readers that Christ makes Jew and non-Jew one <i>"by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations." </i>Ephesians 2:15a (NIV) Jesus fulfilled the Law, became our sacrificial lamb, and made us right with God through His sacrifice. The law was the thing that separated the Jew and non-Jew, but now they are both recipients of the same promises and blessings through accepting Jesus' keeping the law for them. Now there is no difference between believing Jew and another people group that believes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Jews had the promises and words of God. They were God's special people, the family of God. Now, all who believe in Christ have become citizens of heaven, the favored ones, and part of God's family. We stand together on the foundation of the teaching of the apostles and prophets, all of which is squared with the main cornerstone, Jesus Christ. It is in Him that the building takes shape, with you as a part of it, rising to become a holy temple in the Lord.</p>
<p class="indent">Are you on that foundation? Do the words of the prophets and apostles form the basis on which you stand? Is Jesus your point of alignment in all you do today? Then you are a part of His family. You are a part of His temple. You are a habitation of God through the Spirit. The promises of God's word are yours. Though you will face trials that are painful and tough, your destiny is certain. Every test will shape you to fit into your place in this holy Temple.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Yours is a high and holy calling. Don't be moved. Stand firm as the Master Craftsman shapes you to be a perfect fit in Him.</p>
