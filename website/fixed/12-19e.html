<p>1 John 4:4-6 (NIV) <i><sup>4</sup>You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. <sup>5</sup>They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. <sup>6</sup>We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.</i></p>

<p class="indent">John is teaching us that there are really only two spiritual powers in the world. The greatest spiritual force is that of Christ. The other spirit is against Christ. The spirit of antichrist is the spirit of the world. Those who have that spirit will always speak in accordance with the world's perspective. The world will readily listen to that perspective. That spirit teaches that God, if He exists, does not care about man. You are on your own to take what you can from the physical world to satisfy your body and soul. You are all that matters. That makes perfect sense to the world.</p>
<p class="indent">The Spirit of Christ in us teaches us to sacrificially love, as Christ did for us. His Spirit teaches us to lay down our lives for others. He teaches us that it is not about us, but it is about the glory of God. That sounds like foolishness to the world, but to those whom God has chosen, it is the music of truth.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus Christ is the great dividing topic of every culture throughout the world. He will be Lord of our lives, or we will insist on being our own god. The Spirit of truth has prevailed and overcome the world in the heart of every believer. He is the Spirit who will reign supreme throughout eternity. Is He reigning in your heart?</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord Jesus, reign in me supremely! Where there is any vestige of the world's thinking and ways in me, purge it with the truth of your Word. Teach me to love with Your love.</p>
