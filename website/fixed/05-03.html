<p>Judges 7:2 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her,</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">When Gideon sent out the word that he would lead a battle against the Midianites, there was a good response. 32,000 volunteers showed up. God was more concerned about Israel's spiritual health than freeing them from oppression. Though the odds were still greatly against Israel, God said there were too many men. They may take credit for what God did, and then they would be back at square one, in need of an oppressor to cause them to call out to God.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes we have too much talent, too many good ideas, too much ability for the LORD to work. He may let us have our numerical strength, but if it is of man, it will eventually come to naught. For Israel and for us today, God needs insane odds against Him before He really pours out His power. He had Gideon get down to the ridiculous number of 300 men to show it was all God.</p>
<p class="indent">We see some amazing works of man today. After gathering a pool of talent there has been great numerical success. Surely the Lord will work even through that, but a generation will tell if the fruit will remain or if we will be back at square one. When people have called out to God, and unlikely instruments like Luther or Moody were called, the fruit remains.</p>
<p class="indent">Never think you are too lacking in talent or ability or numbers. The Apostle Paul rejoiced in his weaknesses that the glory of God might rest upon him to accomplish God's purposes.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: God is more concerned about your spiritual health than changing your circumstances.</p>
