<p>Numbers 13:30-32 (NIV) <i><sup>30</sup>Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it." <sup>31</sup>But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are." <sup>32</sup>And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Ten spies went out to the Land of Promise, the land that God had promised to Abraham. Upon return, only two believed that they could take the land, Joshua and Caleb. These men were generals, the leading warriors in Israel's army. The other eight spread a bad report and warned that they would be devoured. Looking back, it seems amazing that they did not have the faith to proceed. God had promised to go before them and drive out the enemy. They had evidence of wonderful fruit. The generals said it could be done. The alternative is to stay in the desert. Why would they listen to the eight pessimists?</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, why do we? We have the promises of God. We have seen His provision. We have seen the wonderful fruit from the Land of Promise in the lives of those who have gone in before us. The Generals (Apostles and Prophets) all say, <i>"We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it." </i>And yet we listen to the pessimists.</p>
<p class="indent">What giants are you fearing? Do you really want to wander in the desert? Are the giants so big in God's eyes? And whose battle is it anyway? Obey the call of God, and march forward in faith. He will go before you and the land and all the fruit of it will be yours. Walk by faith and not by sight!</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Am I listening to the voice of faith or doubt?</p>
