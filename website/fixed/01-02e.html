<p>Daniel 12:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>"At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people&#8211;everyone whose name is found written in the book&#8211;will be delivered. <sup>2</sup>Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. <sup>3</sup>Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Daniel had an incredible vision of an angel in Daniel 10. This being is so awesome that Daniel had to receive strength to be able to function in his presence. The angel said it took 21 days to get to him because of the prince of Persia. That evil force must be the demonic power that reigned over Persia. It seems that power is always trying to destroy the Jews, and he probably still is.</p>
<p class="indent">He gives Daniel a long list of future events, including details about the Antichrist. In this last chapter of Daniel, the angel speaks of another angel, Michael, rising up to protect his people. Daniel's people are the Jews. He warns of events that are more horrible than any the world has ever witnessed, and yet the Jews are miraculously delivered. The dead will be raised. Some will rise to everlasting life, and others to be forever ashamed. The wise will shine like the heavens. A common literary device in Hebrew is to repeat an expression using different terms. The wise are those who lead many to righteousness. Shining like the heavens is to shine like the stars.</p>
<p class="indent">How will you awake when that day comes? Many of Daniel's prophecies have come to pass with amazing detail. This one will also. You will rise from the dead in a transformed body to spend eternity in shining brilliance or in eternal shame. Your life affects your eternal destiny.</p>
