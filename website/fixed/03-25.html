<p>Deuteronomy 6:10-12 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you&#8211;a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, <sup>11</sup>houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant&#8211;then when you eat and are satisfied, <sup>12</sup>be careful that you do not forget the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.</i></p>

<p class="indent">There is a cycle in the history of man that emphasizes the importance of these verses. When societies and cultures do well and have time for leisure, they tend to become decadent. The old expression, "An idle mind is the Devil's workshop" is only true because the heart of man is evil. Then as the culture becomes more and more vile, it is easily overthrown. God allows an enemy to put an end to the wickedness to turn the people back and stop the destructiveness of evil that is running unchecked.</p>
<p class="indent">In the verses today, God is warning His people that when they receive the blessings He has promised, they need to be careful not to forget the Giver of the blessings. Do not forget the One who delivered you from bondage. If we do, we end up back in bondage. He delivered us that we might love and serve Him, which is only right. He did not deliver us just so we could please ourselves. That is another form of bondage.</p>
<p class="indent">Where are you today? If you are in the midst of the blessing of God, enjoying the goodness of His blessings, be careful. Be a slave to nothing and no one but God. He is your Deliverer and the Giver of all good things. He enjoys giving you good things.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Thank Him for His goodness by keeping first things first.</p>
