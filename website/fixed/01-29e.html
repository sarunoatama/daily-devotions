<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>January 29</h1>
<p>Matthew 4:18-20 (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <sup>19</sup>"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men." <sup>20</sup>At once they left their nets and followed him.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">This was not the first time they had met. John tells us that they had even baptized people at Jesus' direction while down in Judea. They had seen His miracle of turning water into wine and believed in Him. Luke tells us that this call came after the miraculous catch of fish. The expression, <i>"Follow me!" </i>is used 19 times in the Gospels. To get a sense of this expression and its forcefulness, think of it used to call your dog when he is running off. "Come back!" It can also mean, "Come behind me!" When He first met them, He asked them to "accompany" Him. (John 1:43) Now He is telling them that it is time to become a follower. In doing so, they will learn a new occupation, netting men. Not everyone is called to leave their occupation. The Apostle Paul told the Thessalonians that they should be employed.</p>
<p class="indent">We are all called to learn from Jesus the art of netting men and to learn of Him. We tend to want to learn from others, or imitate their methods. Jesus knows our gifts and make up. He will teach you in the way He has uniquely designed you.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are called to "Come after!" you will know it is the LORD. Many enter into ministry at the first call to "accompany me", but then they wonder why they struggle so. They would be more fruitful to work within the occupation they left. Right there in the business world are those who could be reached by a consistent testimony from a fellow worker. If the call comes to "Come after!", everything that is your old way of life is left behind. Your old security nets, the things with which you are familiar, are forsaken. You cast yourself upon God, and He teaches you your new calling.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: In either case, learn from Him.</p>
