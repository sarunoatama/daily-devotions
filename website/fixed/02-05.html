<p>Exodus 12:37-38 (NIV) <i><sup>37</sup>The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. <sup>38</sup>Many other people went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.</i></p>

<p class="indent">In the area of what was the city of Rameses, where the Israelites lived, archeologists have recently uncovered Hebrew dwellings from this time period. Never forget you are reading true stories as well as the hand of God upon human history, revealing Himself to all who will see. One plague after another hit the things the Egyptians considered to be gods, but God spared the Children of Israel. God was demonstrating the truth to the Egyptian nation in each and every plague. If blessings (Joseph and the dreams of the Pharaoh) will not turn us to Him, then He will allow plagues that in the end will be for our good, if we heed the message.</p>
<p class="indent">In the above verses, we see that God was successful in converting a great number of them. When the Children of Israel left <i>"many other people went up with them." </i>I imagine this was when Moses second wife was converted (Numbers 12:1). These Egyptians, as new believers, joined this great throng coming out of Egypt. They had seen the true God demonstrate through the plagues that He was the only God. They believed His message. They also saw the lives of the Children of Israel and, though culturally very different, they chose to band with those who followed the true God.</p>
<p class="indent">Many are converted today in the hardships of life as they see that the gods they cling to cannot save or even help. We must be there with an example that our God does care and will help so they can join a different nation that is coming out of the world, a nation whose citizenship is in heaven.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord Jesus, make my life a demonstration of your love that others may want to follow You and be delivered from the world.</p>
