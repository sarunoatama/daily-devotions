<p>1 Kings 18:21 (NIV) <i><sup>21</sup>Elijah went before the people and said, "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him." But the people said nothing.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Elijah had Ahab meet him on Mt. Carmel with 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of Asherah. The people of Israel gathered to watch the showdown. After three and a half years without rain, did they still believe Baal brought the blessing of rain? He asked them point blank, but they do not answer him one word. What would it take? What will it take today, as we see the weather plaguing us instead of blessing us? How long will the people of the world look to the god of science? How long will we waver between two opinions? People do not want to believe in God because they intrinsically realize that if He is real, He is worthy of our worship. If He is our Creator, then we owe all to Him.</p>
<p class="indent">God was wooing Israel back to Himself with a challenge to believe. He had showed the impotence of their supposed gods, just as He had done before when He brought them out of Egypt. What will it take? Though Israel's false god could not perform for them, they refused to believe in the God that had already performed miracles throughout their history. How many times does God have to miraculously show us that He alone is God? We will look at history and take lessons of the past as valid instruction today in the secular sense. Why not learn from the history of the many ways that God has proven Himself to be the Almighty One?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: If there are trials and circumstances in your life today, they may be the mercy of God to ask you, "How long will you waver between two opinions?"</p>
