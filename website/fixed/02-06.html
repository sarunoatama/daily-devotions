<p>Exodus 14:12-14 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!" <sup>13</sup>Moses answered the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. <sup>14</sup>The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."</i></p>

<p class="indent">One minute they were worshipping God for their deliverance, and the next, they were whining about their fears. So it went for the next 40 years. How like us! I think that is one reason God chose the Jews; they so consistently demonstrate man's vacillation from faith to fear. There before them was the presence of God in the form of a cloud. They saw the angel of God. They had seen the plagues on Egypt, but here, in what looked like impossible circumstances, mountains on two sides, a sea in front, and an army behind, they forgot all that God had done in the past and even what He was doing at the moment. Fear blinds us to reality. No wonder we so often encounter the words, <i>"Do not be afraid" </i>in Scripture.</p>
<p class="indent">Your condition is no different than theirs. God will take you to the same impossible places so that you can learn that all you need do is <i>"to be still". "The LORD will fight for you...!" </i>It is God's will to deliver you from the world and from trust in yourself, so that you can follow Him to the Promised Land. He will fight for you if you will let Him. What would have happened if the Children of Israel had attacked the trained army of Pharaoh, trusting in their own might? God always has a better plan. His plan builds our faith and shows the enemy that the LORD is God.</p>
<p class="comment">Scriptural advice: Be still. Do not be afraid. The battle is the LORD's!</p>
