<p>Hebrews 13:3-5, 8 (NIV) <i><sup>3</sup>Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering. <sup>4</sup>Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. <sup>5</sup>Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you."</i></p>
<p><i><sup>8</sup>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The letters in the New Testament sometimes end with a list of one- line instructions. This is the case with Hebrews. I have just pulled a few. They are all worth heeding.</p>
<p class="indent">A great number in the body of Christ live under the threat of persecution. We should remember them in our prayers and do what we can to assist them as if we were there among them. The Voice of the Martyrs and several other organizations exist to help the persecuted church. Read their stories, and let your heart be touched to pray and give.</p>
<p class="indent">Our world is trying to destroy the foundation of the home, marriage with fidelity. God is faithful. That is the one reason we should be faithful. Since marriage is a picture of our relationship with Christ, infidelity is a picture of idolatry. No wonder the godless are bashing the institution of marriage.</p>
<p class="indent">Contentment should come from the fact that our greatest need is met in Christ Jesus. He is our Provider. He gives us what we need. His presence in our lives should be the source of our contentment. If we are not content, we have set our heart on something other than Christ.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, though everything in the physical world changes, Jesus Christ will eternally be the same awesome Savior that He is and always has been. He is the rock we must cling to in an ever-changing world.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: When I am discontented, I must discover what my heart has fixed upon outside of Christ.</p>
