<p>2 Timothy 2:14-15 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. <sup>15</sup>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</i></p>

<p class="indent">We can become so technical and precise that we are constantly correcting others, insisting on our preferred wording. It helps to remember that you once did not see things as clearly as you do today, and that tomorrow you will hopefully see things more clearly. That means you express yourself somewhat differently as you grow in the knowledge of the Lord. So cut yourself and others around you some slack. Don't focus on what you can correct, but what you can learn from others. It is pride that insists on others seeing the details as you do. It may be helpful to share your understanding in humility. You may find the person you are trying to correct will give you greater insight. <i>Quarreling about words only ruins those who listen.</i> It is a warning sign that you are in a prideful spirit. It never helps.</p>
<p class="indent">Paul told Timothy to do his best to present himself as an approved workman. His work is handling the Scriptures. They apply to every situation, speak to every audience, and correct every problem, if we know which ones are applicable by the Spirit. Our part is to be familiar with them so that the Spirit can quicken them.</p>
<p class="indent">Are you doing your best to present yourself to God as one approved? Are you familiarizing yourself with the Scriptures so that they are available to be applied to your life? Sometimes we discern the appropriate verse, but we don't make the applications and share the Word with those who need it. Ask the Holy Spirit to bring to mind the appropriate passage AND to make an application. Then, share it with those who need it. It will be an example to them and give you the guidance that is needed for the moment.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: We need to let the Word of Christ live in us richly (Colossians 3:16).</p>
