<p>Numbers 11:27-29 (NIV) <i><sup>27</sup>A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp." <sup>28</sup>Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and said, "Moses, my lord, stop them!" <sup>29</sup>But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"</i></p>

<p class="indent">When Moses was too burdened with caring for all the people, the LORD had him bring all the elders together and put His Spirit on them. They all began to prophesy. Two men who were not called were out in the camp, and they were prophesying also. Moses' general, Joshua, insisted they be stopped. Moses answer shows us the heart of a genuine God inspired leader.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>"Are you jealous for my sake?" </i>"What are you saying Joshua? Do you think I should be jealous that they too have been given the Spirit? Do you want everyone to look to me? Do you think God should work only within the confines of our choices (in recognizing who is an elder)?" Moses never wanted to be the number one man. His mistakes and years of humbly shepherding sheep had taught him who he was. Do you know who you are? Once we see the depravity of the human condition we will desire everyone be full of the Holy Spirit to help us. It is not a competition! We are working together to see people choose the Kingdom of Light.</p>
<p class="indent">Leadership positions often foster rivalries. That is the petty jealousies of men. It is blindness to the Kingdom perspective and focused on the success of an individual. People today say the same thing as Joshua when people in the congregation are anointed to serve. A person who is not an official elder, but one in heart, will teach from the Word. That is how we recognize they are, an elder. The life comes before the title. Eldad and Medad were not officially recognized by anyone but God. Encourage the expression of the gifts in everyone. Recognize God's choices. Quench not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Am I jealous for my leader or for God's kingdom?</p>
