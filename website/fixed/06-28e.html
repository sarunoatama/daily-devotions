<p>John 14:15-17 (NIV) <i><sup>15</sup>"If you love me, you will obey what I command. <sup>16</sup>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever&#8211; <sup>17</sup>the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Do you love Jesus? Then you obey His command. What is His command? <i>"My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you." </i>John 15:12 You can't answer "yes" and harbor anger in your heart toward someone. Jesus made that clear. To love others, you must be forgiving, willing to put them first, and most of all, you must be willing to allow God's love to flow through you.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus said that if you wanted the Holy Spirit, you need to ask the Father to give Him to you (Luke 11:13). John reminds us that Jesus had one other condition, obedience. But it is not obedience to the 613 rules in the Old Testament. Jesus narrowed it down to one, <i>"...obey what I command."</i></p>
<p class="indent">If you will do that by His grace, He promises to ask the Father to send you the Counselor, the Spirit of truth. Here is the great difference in Christianity. Other religions taught blood atonement, ways to God, and love for others, but Christianity teaches that God will come and live in and through you. That was something totally new to those who listened to Jesus. It is not a "do it yourself" religion. It is an invitation to personally experience Life, on a daily, hourly, minute-by-minute basis.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are of God, then you love and believe in the One He sent. If you love the One He sent then you obey Him. If you obey Him (loving one another) then you will experience the presence of the Counselor, the Spirit of Truth, living in you forever. The world cannot express true love because it is self-focused. It chooses to obey its selfish whims. That is why it cannot receive the Counselor.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The last words in verse 17 tell us the difference between the presence of the Spirit before and after Pentecost in two words, "with" and "in". Are you experiencing "in"?</p>
