<p>John 6:27-29 (NIV) <i><sup>27</sup>Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval." <sup>28</sup>Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?" <sup>29</sup>Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."</i></p>

<p class="indent">In the story of Jesus with the woman at the well, Jesus told His disciples that He had food to eat that they knew nothing about. Now He is telling them that He has food to give that endures to eternal life. Most of us work to put perishable food on the table. The problem comes when you labor FOR the food instead of the reason of faithfulness to the LORD. Working for food is short-sighted and on the level of animal life. God has given man a much higher calling in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="indent">The crowd, ever obsessed with finding the quintessential rule, asked, <i>"What must we do to do the works God requires?" </i>God had given hundreds of laws through Moses. The prophets seem to have focused the essence down to a few key laws. Now they wanted one work that would get them into heaven. Jesus had the answer, only it was not a work they could perform, but the work of another. <i>"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."</i> Do you want to receive the food that endures to eternal life? Do you want the water that is an eternal fountain? Do you want satisfaction in that void in your heart both now and forever? Believe in the one God has sent.</p>
<p class="indent">When you believe that He is the One that the Father has provided to make you right with Him, then you will go to Him for the eternal food. Though you consume His wonderful words, they can be eaten again and again. The wonder is that instead of getting used to them, they get sweeter each time. For what are you living? I hope you have not given up and settled for the things of creation that are passing. They satisfy less and less with each successive consumption.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before.</p>
