<p>Exodus 4:1-2 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>Moses answered, "What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, 'The LORD did not appear to you'?" <sup>2</sup>Then the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Moses is still worried about whether he would be accepted and believed. <i>"What if..." </i>We always have our "what ifs". They are usually a description of our fear and our lack of faith in God. What if we just trusted God and obeyed by faith? If we have to voice 'what if' then turn it into a positive 'what if'.</p>
<p class="indent">God then pointed Moses to something already in his possession. <i>"What is that in your hand?" </i>What has God already given you? It is a useful instrument or a gift or talent, but when God anoints it for service to Him, it becomes supernatural. It was just a staff to guide sheep, but it will become a rod to guide a nation. It will be an instrument that brings plagues on the enemy. It will be an instrument to part a sea and drown an army. It will be an instrument to strike a rock and bring forth water for a thirsty nation. It is just a staff. But when it is used as God directs, it will be God's own instrument to bring His intervention into the world.</p>
<p class="indent">And what is in your hand? What has God gifted you with? It may seem very ordinary, but when it is yielded to God and used at His direction, it can become extraordinary.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: May the Lord turn all my 'what ifs' into positive ones and the things He has given me into His instruments.</p>
