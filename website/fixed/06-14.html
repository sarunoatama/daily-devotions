<p>1 Kings 8:10-11 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the LORD. <sup>11</sup>And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled his temple.</i></p>

<p class="indent">When Solomon had finished building the temple that David had planned, the priests stepped out of the Holy Place (an inner room of the temple). Then a cloud filled the temple of the LORD. The Hebrews associated clouds with the glory of God. Their ancestors had seen the cloud on Sinai when Moses met with God. The glory of the LORD so filled the temple that the priests could not come in and do their assigned duties.</p>
<p class="indent">Our bodies are the temples of the LORD. Jesus said, "Destroy this temple (meaning his body) and in three days I will raise it up." His body was so full of the glory of God that He did nothing except what the Father showed Him. Jesus didn't really have His own ministry isolated and of itself. He was a yielded instrument to the glory of His Father. He got out of the way and let God work, and so <i>"we have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."</i> John 1:14 (NIV) The glory of the Father was the operating source in Him.</p>
<p class="indent">We are often carried away with our ministry, and wrapped up in what must be done. If we are not careful and focused we will end up ministering from the wrong source. The glory needs to fill our temple, our earthly body. Then there is no room for us to get in the way and make a mess of things. The glory needs to fill us so that He is the source of our activity and we are merely submitted vessels for that glory.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: What is the source of your activity? Is your temple filled with the glory of God?</p>
