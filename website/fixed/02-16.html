<p>Exodus 28:30 (NIV) <i><sup>30</sup>Also put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastpiece, so they may be over Aaron's heart whenever he enters the presence of the LORD. Thus Aaron will always bear the means of making decisions for the Israelites over his heart before the LORD.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The LORD gave Moses detailed instructions for the Tabernacle (a mobile house of worship) and all its furniture and instruments. The priests had special clothing that they were to wear when they ministered. The High Priest had a breastpiece that had twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel. We do not know the details of the Urim and Thummim, but they are believed to be two additional stones that were used to determine the LORD's will. Since the Spirit of God came upon people, but did not live in their hearts until Pentecost, the people needed some way to determine the LORD's leading. Some believe that these stones would glow, one for a 'yes' answer, the other for a 'no' answer. They were worn over his heart.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people today would love to have the Urim and Thummim. I often hear people say, "If God would just send me a fax, it would be so much easier." God desires us to have an intimate relationship with Him. I'm grateful I live in a day when I do not have to consult a stone, but instead have the Spirit of God living in my heart. If I have been walking in communion with Him, the answer is always clear and very personal. I get a 'yes' or a 'no' or no glow at all in my heart. No glow at all means I'm not ready to know the answer, or I'm asking the wrong question and need not worry about it now. That is the time when people would like that fax from God. But God is telling us, "Trust me! I know what is best and will tell you when you need to know." His "not now" answer should be sufficient for us. Trust Him!</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: God can speak to your heart when you need an answer as long as you genuinely desire to know His will.</p>
