<p>Luke 17:20-21 (NIV) <i><sup>20</sup>Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, <sup>21</sup>nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you."</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Jews believed the Messiah would lead them to victory over all their enemies and set up a Jewish nation like that of David's. If Jesus was this Messiah, their natural question would be when He would begin this kingdom. Jesus' answer shows that His perspective of the Kingdom of God is very different from theirs. As usual, they are thinking on very physical and temporal terms, whereas Jesus is speaking about spiritual realities that are eternal.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus told them that we would not be able to carefully watch as things changed step by step. It is not an outward event. You won't be able to point to a specific battle or political maneuver. The Kingdom is something that takes place within a person. The Kingdom of God is established in a heart when the King of kings reigns in that heart. Then that person is a subject of the King and has entered into the Kingdom.</p>
<p class="indent">You can see the transformation in the life of the person because he serves a new master. Jesus began His ministry preaching the same message as John. "Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand." Since the resurrection of Jesus, the Kingdom is preached. We often hear a compromising form of the Gospel that implies you get a free ticket to heaven and go on being your own king. Is that really entering the Kingdom? The Kingdom has come to every heart in which the King reigns.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Is He reigning in you?</p>
