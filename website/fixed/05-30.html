<p>2 Samuel 7:11b-13 (NIV) <i><sup>11b</sup>I will also give you rest from all your enemies. "'The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you: <sup>12</sup>When your days are over and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom. <sup>13</sup>He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</i></p>

<p class="indent">David built a fine cedar palace for himself and began to wonder if he shouldn't build a house for God. Nathan told him to do whatever is in his heart, as the LORD is with him. That night the LORD spoke to the prophet Nathan and told him to return to David with a message. Part of that message is today's passage.</p>
<p class="indent">Buildings are very temporal things. The real house is the people that live in it. God told David it was not David that would do for God, but God who was doing for David. God would establish a house for him. Jesus was a descendant from David and will reign forever. He is called the Son of David. God has established a lasting Davidic dynasty.</p>
<p class="indent">The house built for God, the lasting one of people, is being built by that descendant and heir. That is why Jesus told Peter, "I will build my church." He was not referring to a building. Neither was God in this passage. The Father and Son were both speaking of those called out of the world to become sons and daughters of God. People are still trying to build God a house today. There is nothing wrong with a building, but God is after a house of living stones. He is the builder. It is built for His Name. It will be eternal. Are you a part of that house?</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Thank you Lord for making me a part of your house.</p>
