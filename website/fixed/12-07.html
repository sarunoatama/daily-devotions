<p>Isaiah 62:1, 6-7 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem's sake I will not remain quiet, till her righteousness shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>6</sup>I have posted watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD, give yourselves no rest, <sup>7</sup>and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">The Lord desires our constant intercession. He asks us to pray without ceasing. Regardless of how you interpret Zion and Jerusalem, we are not to remain silent. We need to share the great love of our God until so many enter the Kingdom of God that righteousness shines like the dawn and their salvation like a blazing torch. The more an area is converted and sharing their life's example, the more the Spirit of God dominates that area. People can't help but come under the conviction of the Holy Spirit, because He works through the prayers of God's people.</p>
<p class="indent">The LORD pleads with us to never rest from intercession. He wants us to give Him no rest, but to bombard heaven with requests for salvation and the transformation of lives.</p>
<p class="indent">One day the heavenly city will be established in Jerusalem. The world will come to worship on bended knee, confessing Jesus as LORD. Peace and righteousness will be the order of the Kingdom, but until that day comes keep praying. Keep interceding for the lost. Keep heaven busy with your prayer requests. Don't be silent! Don't let entertainment, or any distraction, steal your time with God. It has eternal value. Pray!</p>
