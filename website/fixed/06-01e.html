<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>June 1</h1>
<p>John 3:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. <sup>7</sup>You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' <sup>8</sup>The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."</i></p>

<p class="indent">One of the Jewish religious leaders came to Jesus at night. He probably did not want to be seen by his colleagues, because they were jealous of Jesus. He admitted that they knew Jesus came from God because of the miracles He performed. His name was Nicodemus. He had one thing on his mind, and Jesus knew what it was before he asked. <i>"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again," </i>Jesus told him.</p>
<p class="indent">Like most of the folks in the Bible, he was thinking literally in regards to what Jesus was speaking symbolically of. To explain, Jesus spoke the passage for this evening. Flesh gives birth to flesh. A human body gives birth to a human body, but if you are going to be born from above, you must be born of spirit, for God is a spirit. Surely a religious leader like Nicodemus should be able to understand such a thing. Actually, it was amazing that he had a hunger for the truth at all. The religious establishment was so corrupt that power and money were the driving forces of their decisions. We'll see Nicodemus later in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus went on to say that the person born of the Spirit is like the wind. The word for spirit and wind is the same in the languages of the Bible. You hear the wind, but can't tell where it came from or where it is going. The person born of the Spirit doesn't understand God's past working in their life, and they don't know where God will lead them tomorrow. Life is an adventure with God. Nicodemus thought he knew where he came from and where he would be tomorrow. His life was all planned out. He was working his way up the ladder of power and influence, but the truth was getting in the way and nagging him with doubts about the validity of his goals.</p>
<p class="indent">Are you born of the Spirit? Is God free to direct your life as your Lord and Master, or are you headed in the direction you have set for yourself? Is there a question in your heart as to the validity of your goals?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Sit down with your Maker and let Him show you that a life of faith is incomparably superior.</p>
