<p>Genesis 3:6 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Yesterday we saw a few of Satan's strategies, and in this verse, we see why they are effective. In 1 John 2:15-17, John wrote that the world consists of the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life. When Satan was able to get Eve to question God, she looked at the fruit. The child of God is to walk by faith and not by sight. We are to see in the spiritual realm with our spiritual eyes what is eternal and not be tricked by what we see in the physical. It looked good for food. Was it? As good as death! But she allowed her eyes to deceive her, instead of trusting in what God had said.</p>
<p class="indent">The fruit looked like it could satisfy her natural desires. The world never really satisfies. We often think it can fill the void within, but it leaves us hungrier than before. Like all addictions, there is some satisfaction, but you need to constantly increase the quantity of money, drugs, food, sex or whatever it is you are seeking to fill your emptiness. Finally that excess ends in an empty death. The void within us can only be filled by the eternal, infinite God.</p>
<p class="indent">She thought it would make her wise. There is a grain of truth in Satan's lies. She would know what it was to rebel against God, to feel remorse, to be separated from His presence, to fear His justice.</p>
<p class="indent">These three weaknesses that both this story and the Apostle John described are with us today as much as ever. Recognize them! They are of the world. The world and its lusts pass away, but he who does the will of His Father lives forever.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord help me to see that satisfaction is found in God alone.</p>
