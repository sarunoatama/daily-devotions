<p>2 Samuel 15:19-21 (NIV) <i><sup>19</sup>The king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland. <sup>20</sup>You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am going? Go back, and take your countrymen. May kindness and faithfulness be with you." <sup>21</sup>But Ittai replied to the king, "As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Absalom returned his father David's mercy with a coup. David got wind of the revolt and fled with those who were loyal to him. David knew it would be tough, so in the generosity of his spirit, he told the foreigner, Ittai, to stay. Ittai had only recently come to Jerusalem as an exile from his own land.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of taking the easy way out, Ittai chose the tough road with David. Ittai's response shows that David's good spirit must have won his heart. Ittai was probably exiled because of his political savy and not going along with those who led his own country. He could see David was an honest and sincere king. He chose to stay by David's side regardless of the cost.</p>
<p class="indent">It doesn't take long to develop strong friendships if you are a genuinely loving person. The world is looking for sincere people who will be honest, people that will risk their position to be kind. This is how we influence people with the Gospel. They see our sincerity, align themselves with us, and we get to tell them why we live like we do. In time, our God becomes their choice.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Our life must flow from a sincere heart before people will respond to us like Ittai did to David.</p>
