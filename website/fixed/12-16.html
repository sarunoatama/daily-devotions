<p>Jeremiah 23:3-5 (NIV) <i><sup>3</sup>"I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number. <sup>4</sup>I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing," declares the LORD. <sup>5</sup>"The days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will raise up to David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The chapter begins with the LORD rebuking the unfaithful shepherds for scattering the flock of God. Then the LORD says that He will gather them from wherever they have been scattered and place shepherds over them. Like many prophecies, this has an immediate and final fulfillment. The people of Judah were soon to come back from Babylon and would become fruitful and increase. They were gathered from wherever they were scattered in 1948 and became very fruitful and increased. Ultimately this may refer to Second Coming. In the rapture, Jesus will gather His sheep from wherever they are scattered. Is there any other way to see the total lack of fear and none missing? In the other restorations not all returned. Fear was a daily part of life then and now. But when the LORD returns, He will sit as a King and reign in righteousness and justice. We can look forward to that day with hope and expectation.</p>
<p class="indent">He is referred to as the righteous Branch that is raised up from David. Jesus was the lineage of David. Several places in Scripture we have a picture of a lineage as a tree. There has never been a king over Israel, descended from David, who was righteous, since that prophecy. But that day is coming.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: We can look forward to the just and righteous reign of our King, the King of kings, the Branch of David.</p>
