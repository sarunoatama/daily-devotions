<p>Matthew 24:37-39 (NIV) <i><sup>37</sup>As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup>38</sup>For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; <sup>39</sup>and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus taught that His return would not be in secret. He said it would be more like lightening shining in the east and visible in the west. The prophet Zechariah details some of the earth shaking things that will happen at that moment. Then Jesus warned that no one in heaven or earth knew when that would be. He said that only the Father knew. He gave us signs to look for (see yesterday's evening devotion). Yet, He taught that it will be a shock to everyone.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus compares His Second Coming to the great flood in the days of Noah. Noah built that ark over a period of time as he preached to the people (2 Peter 2:5). Yet, the people did not listen or even consider that their world was about to end. They were going about their lives, doing the things that people normally do. If you knew the world was about to end, you wouldn't stop to eat, drink or marry. The last moments would be too precious. Jesus said they knew nothing about what would happen until it came to pass. How could they hear Noah's preaching and see the great boat and yet know nothing? There are none so blind as those who refuse to see.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus has given us signs to look for. When they come to pass, only the righteous will take it to heart and be prepared. Jesus is the great ark. Only those in Him will be ready for the flood that is to come upon the earth. If any man has ears to hear, let him hear (Matthew 11:15). The world will be going about its self-gratifying ways when destruction comes upon it. Though the message is preached and the warnings are given, only those that are willing will hear. The cares and pleasures of life can deaden our ears to the truth that is preached to us.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are your ears willing to hear?</p>
