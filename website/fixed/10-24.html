<p>Psalms 103:10-12 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. <sup>11</sup>For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; <sup>12</sup>as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</i></p>

<p class="indent">These songs of praise are rich with teaching. In this psalm, the writer tells us a fact we need to remember. We never get what we deserve. Never ask for justice, or you may get it. We always forget our sins and remember our good deeds with a little embellishment. If we got what we deserve, we would all be cast into the Lake of Fire. We are by nature rebels against the loving goodness of our Creator. Instead of giving us what we deserve, God lavished His love upon us by sending His one and only Son to take what we deserved. Only Jesus could bear it.</p>
<p class="indent">How did we ever learn to fear Him, that is, to reverence His just nature that will not let sin go unpunished? It is only an undeserved gift of grace! It is an expression of His great love. That love is much greater than you or I could ever muster. What is your attitude toward those who have betrayed your love for them? God just continues to love us to the fullest extent of His love.</p>
<p class="indent">Satan would try to get us to dwell on all our failures and past mistakes. God doesn't, so why should we? Satan's accusations are true, but so is the fact that those sins are covered by the sacrifice of Jesus. They are removed from us as far as east is from west. That is a long ways! Next time the enemy tries to get you down about a past sin, remind him of this verse. The future is as bright as the promises of God. You are a work in transition, but the scrap that has been chiseled away is already cleaned up and hauled off.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Look forward, not back, and praise God for loving you so! Praise Him for sending Jesus to get what you deserved.</p>
