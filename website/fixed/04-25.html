<p>Joshua 7:1a, 4-5a (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>But the Israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things... <sup>4</sup>So about three thousand men went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai, <sup>5a</sup>who killed about thirty-six of them.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Everything in Jericho belonged to the LORD. He gave the victory, and as a sign of faith that the LORD would deliver the rest of their enemies into their hands, they were to give everything to God. One man, Achan, kept some of the spoils of war. He buried it under his tent. He must have thought that no one would ever know the difference.</p>
<p class="indent">When Israel went to the next battle, they chose a small city named Ai. They sent just 3,000 soldiers, for they thought the size of the city would warrant no more than that. To their surprise they were defeated and lost 36 men. Why? After such a miraculous victory over a much larger city, what went wrong?</p>
<p class="indent">Joshua fell on his face and cried out to God. God told him to get up and deal with the sin of Israel. There is a principle here that relates to us today. Because God is holy, He does not bless hidden sin. He cannot overlook rebellion. Achan was just one man, but he held up the whole nation. His actions indirectly caused the death of those 36 men. God said Israel had sinned, when in fact it was one man. Until that sin was dealt with God would not bless their actions.</p>
<p class="indent">The same can be true in our life. One area cannot slide by in rebellion and we still have the blessing of God. It is true for our families, for our churches, our cities, and our nation. We need to allow God to expose the sin, so that we can forsake it, find forgiveness, and be blessed. <i><sup>13</sup>He who conceals his sins does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.</i> Proverbs 28:13 (NIV)</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Have I done something that would stop the blessing of God?</p>
