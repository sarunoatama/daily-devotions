<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>April 22</h1>
<p>Joshua 5:11-12 (NIV) <i><sup>11</sup>The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain. <sup>12</sup>The manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate of the produce of Canaan.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Israel celebrated their first Passover in the Promised Land. As soon as they ate the food of that land, the manna stopped. I wonder if the next morning they got up by habit to go out and collect it. For forty years God had provided angels' food for them on a daily basis Now that they are home, they can eat of the good of the land that God has given them.</p>
<p class="indent">God provides for us. He is Jehovah Jireh, "the LORD provides". He won't give us too much, but He will give us enough to sustain us. As we travel through this life, as long as we have a need, the LORD will provide. We can count on our daily manna. As long as we go out to gather it and don't try to keep it over night, we will always be able to fill our jars. We will have just enough.</p>
<p class="indent">But that land to which we are going will have an abundance and variety. The Lord is still our portion and our cup, but instead of coming from above, He will be all around us. One day, the angel of the second death will pass over us because of what Jesus did in our place. Then we will be home and eating freely of the abundance of the land.</p>
