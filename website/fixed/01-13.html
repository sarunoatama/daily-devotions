<p>Genesis 12:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>The LORD had said to Abram, "Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you. <sup>2</sup>"I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. <sup>3</sup>I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."</i></p>

<p class="indent">God called Abram (later to be changed to Abraham) out of his culture and family to follow God to an undisclosed place. It seems that, of all the people of the earth, Abram was selected for a very special calling. Later we see he did not follow exactly, as he disobeyed God by taking along his family instead of leaving them. He also lied twice about his relationship to his wife to save his own hide. Still, he did go out by faith, not knowing his destination.</p>
<p class="indent">The promise that all the world would be blessed through him makes us wonder if this lineage of the Seed of the woman that will crush the head of Satan, that has gone down through Noah, is not now through Abraham. Later we find this to be the case. He is an imperfect man that is a recipient of great promises. He obeyed, but not fully. Is that not true of us too? Imperfect though our lives are, through grace, God has called us out of our world to be citizens of a place that we are going to by faith. Like Abraham we believe there is a city with foundations whose builder and maker is God.</p>
<p class="indent">We are those who have been blessed through Abram, because we have received Jesus' work in our place. Perhaps that is why Matthew begins his genealogy of Jesus at Abraham. You may have stumbled along the way to your heavenly home and your reward, but like Abraham, God will see you through. In Hebrews there is no record of Abram's failures, only his great acts of faith.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: In heaven there will be no record of your failures either, just your acts of faith.</p>
