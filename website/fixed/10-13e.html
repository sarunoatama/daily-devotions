<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>October 13</h1>
<p>Philippians 3:18-21 (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. <sup>19</sup>Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things. <sup>20</sup>But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, <sup>21</sup>who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Two types of people are presented here, citizens of heaven and citizens of earth. There are those that love the cross and those who are enemies of its message. There are those whose destiny is destruction and those whose destiny is heaven. One has their mind on earthly things, the other is focused on heavenly things. One glories in shameful things, the other in godly things.</p>
<p class="indent">Some will try to stand between those two worlds, but it can't be done. You will be drawn to one or the other. As children of God, we are to live lives that will attract the citizens of the earth, not confuse them. Sometimes the children of God will act as if the earthly has value. We speak the language of the earth. We act as if we are pleased with the things of the world. The citizens of earth need to see our desire is in another place.</p>
<p class="indent">We know that one day, everything will be under the control of Christ. That gives us great delight because we have come to know how gracious and good He is. Living as children of the light should help the citizens of earth see that.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, our hope is in the transformation of these bodies, not holding on to them. We desire the attachments to the worldly to pass away that our focus might be completely on Him. It is coming! Your transformation is at hand. Your lowly body will be like His. Then you will be able to know Him and the power of His resurrection. Then you will know life in all its fullness.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Realizing that transformation is coming loosens our ties with this life but strengthens our commitment to service here.</p>
