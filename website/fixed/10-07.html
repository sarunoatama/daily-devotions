<p>Psalms 37:4-5, 7 (NIV) <i><sup>4</sup>Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. <sup>5</sup>Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this:... <sup>7</sup>Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.</i></p>

<p class="indent">In this psalm, David is reflecting on the fact that the evil ones who threatened his life and plotted against him were ultimately unsuccessful. He is telling us the secret of his success and usefulness to God. If there are wicked people troubling your life, listen to David's advice.</p>
<p class="indent">Delight yourself in the LORD. If your highest hopes and greatest joys are in the LORD, the LORD will give you your desires. There are two ways to look at that promise. One is that your desire for more of God and a closer relationship with Him will come to pass. If you are in Him, your enemies will find themselves fighting God. The other way to see this promise is that God will place His own desires in your heart so that you desire the things God desires. I think both are true.</p>
<p class="indent">If you dedicate your actions to God, walking in His ways, desiring what He desires, then you can count on God bringing this to pass. That spells trouble for your enemies and turns you from fear and fretting to joy and trust. The commitment of the heart is met by the enabling power of the God that transforms you.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of fretting and getting all worked up, wait patiently in stillness before God. Don't act without acting in Him and at His direction and you can know you will succeed. You will have the peace that guarantees the schemes of the wicked will ultimately be for your good. The final word will be a vindication of your righteous trust in God.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: What should you do about the trouble facing you today? Delight yourself in the LORD, and commit your way to Him. Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for Him.</p>
