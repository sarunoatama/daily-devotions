<p>John 14:23,26-27 (NIV) <i><sup>23</sup>Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>26</sup>But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. <sup>27</sup>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus promised that, if we loved Him and obeyed His teaching, the Father and He would come and make their home with us. The Holy Spirit will live in us. Here is a clear picture of the three in one God. Think about what it means for Him to be at home with us. If God sets up His home in you, it will certainly transform your outward life. If He is at home with you, your life will express the love, joy, peace, patience, kindness and gentleness to others. Perhaps you've met someone, and you can tell Jesus is at home with him or her. It is God's desire to make His home with each of us, but there is a prerequisite, to love Him and obey His teaching.</p>
<p class="indent">A few verses later Jesus explained how that is possible. The Holy Spirit would be sent to teach and remind us of Jesus' words. That is His main role within us. He is teaching us the perspective of the Father, what to say, how to say it, and His own attitude toward the world around us. By reminding us of the words of Jesus, He is teaching us to distinguish light from dark and showing us how to respond.</p>
<p class="indent">The presence of the Holy Spirit is the Father and the Son at home in us. His presence is the peace of Christ. That peace transcends situations, because we know that the God who oversees all things is with us through it. The peace of the world is dependent on situations being calm. The peace of Jesus is only dependent on His presence. That is why He can again say, "Do not let your hearts be troubled", and adds, "do not be afraid." If the God of creation is at home in you, He will surely see you through to the glorious future He has planned for His own children.</p>
