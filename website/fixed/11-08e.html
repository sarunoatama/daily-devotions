<p>Hebrews 1:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, <sup>2</sup>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe. <sup>3</sup>The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Hebrews is an incredible letter, but we don't know who the author was. It tells us of Jesus' superiority over angels, prophets, and Moses. It declares that His sacrifice was the fulfillment of the all sacrifices and that He is now our Great High Priest. It gives us a number of important warnings. It encourages us in the importance of faith.</p>
<p class="indent">Hebrews begins by telling us that God no longer speaks to us as He once did. In the past, He used prophets that prophesied in many different manners. Some told parables, some acted out their prophesies, and some wrote poetry. The author of Hebrews declared that now God is speaking to us in Jesus. His life and words are the final and full message of God to man. If you need to hear from God, look to the life and words of Jesus. The Holy Spirit's ministry is to remind us what He has said. (John 14:26)</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus is the heir of everything. He is the instrument of creation. He is the outshining of God's glory. He is the exact representation of God's being. Everything is sustained by his powerful word. What an incredible and glorious description of the Son!</p>
<p class="indent">This powerful declaration goes on to say that Jesus provided purification for sins. This letter will explain why His blood was necessary for our purification. Now, He is sitting in the place of power, at the helm of the universe, at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. Hebrews declares Jesus to be our wonderful Savior, but it also declares His awesome superiority over all His creation. It encourages us to go to Him to access God, but to do so with reverent respect.</p>
