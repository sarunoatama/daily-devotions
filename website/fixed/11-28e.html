<p>James 3:17-18 (NIV) <i><sup>17</sup>But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere. <sup>18</sup>Peacemakers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness.</i></p>

<p class="indent">There are two kinds of wisdom. One is a wisdom that James calls "earthly, unspiritual, and of the devil". It springs from envy and selfish-ambition.</p>
<p class="indent">The other kind of wisdom comes from heaven. It is pure, unpolluted by personal motives and agendas. You can accuse it of such, but in time it will be revealed to be without corruption. It is peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere. You can use these descriptions for each fruit of the Spirit. They should be our plumb line for determining if our conversation is in the Spirit or in the flesh. They reveal the source of any wisdom being expounded, and there are only two sources.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who long to exert control for the sake of envy and selfish ambition sow conflict and divisiveness. They reap bitterness, anger, and animosity. The peacemakers exercise divine wisdom that is impartial. In doing so they reap a harvest of righteousness. By seeking the best for the kingdom of God, though they are submissive, they end up being blessed with a harvest of righteousness.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help me to always express the wisdom that is from above. Guard my heart from earthly wisdom, and open it to your divine wisdom.</p>
