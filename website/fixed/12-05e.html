<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>December 5</h1>
<p>1 Peter 3:1-4 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>Wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, <sup>2</sup>when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. <sup>3</sup>Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. <sup>4</sup>Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.</i></p>

<p class="indent">In many homes, the woman is more spiritual than her husband. She longs for a man that will lead the home spiritually, and so she often prods her husband. Maybe prod is too gentle a word, how about "nags"? She leaves books open to chapters that explain his faults, and cuts out articles that describe men with similar shortcomings. She always invites him to church, but he rarely gives in. Every once in awhile it all gets to be too much, and she just lets him have it, declaring how she wishes he were a better husband.</p>
<p class="indent">That may be the natural reaction of a wife to an unspiritual husband, but Peter says it is not the way to win him. It has the opposite affect. He feels he can never measure up to her high idea of spirituality, so he avoids spiritual things altogether. Don't forget, men like to win. If they feel their wife will out perform them at church, they just won't go.</p>
<p class="indent">Peter says that the love and honor that the wife gives the husband will win his heart. It draws him near. It doesn't take words; it takes a pure and reverent life with the beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit. Not only will that be beautiful to your husband, but to God as well.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Have you been trying to change your husband? You can only change yourself. Peter is describing a woman that is overflowing with the fruit of the Spirit. She realizes that inner beauty is infinitely greater than outward beauty. A powerful woman has her tongue under control and her hope in God.</p>
