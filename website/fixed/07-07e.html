<p>John 17:3-5 (NIV) <i><sup>3</sup>Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. <sup>4</sup>I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. <sup>5</sup>And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.</i></p>

<p class="indent">A dictionary might define eternal life as a life without beginning or end, but Jesus defines it as knowing the only true Eternal One. There is only one true God. Jesus very name means salvation of the Eternal One. What does it mean to know Him? A few of the ideas behind this Greek word include: to learn, to know, come to know, to perceive, to become acquainted with. The ideas include an ever-increasing perception in relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus prayed a prayer of thanks for being able to bring glory to the Father. His complete obedience to the Father's will gave us a demonstration of the heart of the Father. In doing that, He expressed the glory of God. Though He had not yet finished the course, He had determined in His heart that He would, and by faith He counted it done.</p>
<p class="indent">In verse 5, we see the longing of Jesus to return to the presence of the Father. There He would share the glory of the Father, for they are one. It was His existence in eternity past. Can you seen the difference between walking with God in this world and being there in eternity in His presence unhindered by these bodies in their present form? For those who know Him now, it will be the continuation of what we have begun on earth. It will be a deepening of the knowledge of Him.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Have you begun to know Him, the only true God, and Jesus, His salvation? Increase in that knowledge of Him today by bringing Him glory. That happens when we do His will. Then you will be completing the work He has given you to do.</p>
