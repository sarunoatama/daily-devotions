<p>Proverbs 8:34-36 (NIV) <i><sup>34</sup>Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway. <sup>35</sup>For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the LORD. <sup>36</sup>But whoever fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus is wisdom. To find Him is to find life. To hate Him is to love death. The one who listens to Him is blessed. What could be wiser than to listen to your Creator? He is the One who knows your every need and every choice you should make for your eternal good.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a passage that points directly to communion with Christ. Every day we have a choice. We can run into our day as if we knew what we are doing, or we can seek wisdom. To seek wisdom is to wait upon the LORD, to watch at His door, waiting there. It takes time to still our soul, and He does not come out to speak with us until we do.</p>
<p class="indent">You could think of the cover of your Bible as the doorway. Open up the door and let wisdom speak to you. The Word of God made flesh longs to speak wisdom into your spirit. Will you watch and wait until He appears? How much does it mean to you to receive His instruction? It may be only a few words, but those words will shape your day and direct your steps. Those words bring the favor of the LORD, for you have met with Life Himself.</p>
<p class="indent">The alternative is to avoid life, avoid wisdom, and walk without the favor of God upon us. None of us would intentionally choose that, but we do make that choice when we refuse to wait upon God. It is more than worth the time to wait until you are still enough to hear His voice. Don't be satisfied with just leaving a message for Him. Refuse to leave without a meeting in which you hear His words of life.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Wait on the LORD today. Watch at His door daily.</p>
