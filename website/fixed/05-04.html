<p>Judges 7:13-14 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. "I had a dream," he was saying. "A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed." <sup>14</sup>His friend responded, "This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands."</i></p>
<p class="comment">Gideon was still uncertain about taking this vast army with just 300 men. The Lord had appeared to him, consumed his offering, made the fleece dry and the ground wet, the ground dry and the fleece wet, but still he needed more reassurance. Remember this is the guy that the Angel of the LORD called a mighty warrior. Finally, God told him to go down and listen to the conversations in the tents. He snuck into the Midianite camp and heard the above story. Some people call that a coincidence. I call it a "Godincidence". If God is the God of all, the things I hear and the situations I run across are from His hand, then I need to recognize them as such.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally Gideon had the confidence that God was in this. Don't be discouraged if you need extra assurance that God is in something. He is more than able to show you He is. Just be sure you are open to "Godincidences" revealing His will. Once you know it, don't make excuses, act.</p>
<p class="indent">The LORD went ahead of Gideon and prepared the way for the victory God was about to bring. He goes ahead of you, too, when you are walking in His will and following His leading. Trust and do not fear.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: God is in the details of your life to encourage and guide you.</p>
