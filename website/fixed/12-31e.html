<p>Revelation 22:12, 17 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>"Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>17</sup>The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.</i></p>

<p class="indent">You have come to end of Through the Bible Daily Devotional. Be sure to read the whole story, the Bible. It is a story upon which all other stories are based. Jesus is the superhero of all superheroes. He is King that was separated from His kingdom but returned to set things right. He is the one who conquers the dark power of evil. He is the handsome Prince that has come to rescue His damsel in distress, but He is greater than every story that imitates this true story. We could not imagine a more wonderful King, Groom, and Friend.</p>
<p class="indent">It is such a wonderful story that at times we wonder if it is really all true. Will it really turn out this way? Is He really coming soon with our reward? Then the assurance of the Spirit that He has deposited within us says, <i>"Yes! I have not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it. Not one small mark will fail until ALL is fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."</i></p>
<p class="indent">Listen! The Spirit within you says, "Come!" When you think of the end of the curse, the reward that awaits you, and of being forever in His presence, you say "Come!" Everyone that reads the Book or hears the story says, "Come!" Every thirsty soul that wishes may come and drink freely of this gift, the water of life.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: He is coming soon, and His reward is with Him. He will give to each person according to what he or she has done.</p>
