<p>2 Kings 11:13-14 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people, she went to the people at the temple of the LORD. <sup>14</sup>She looked and there was the king, standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes and called out, "Treason! Treason!"</i></p>

<p class="indent">When Amaziah died from the wounds inflicted by Jehu, his mother, Athaliah, decided to take over as supreme ruler. This wicked lady killed all but one of her own grandchildren. A sister of Amaziah hid one of her nephews, a son of the king in the Temple. When the child, Joash, was barely old enough to reign, Athaliah reaped what she had sown. The priest Jehoida declared Joash king at the tender age of 7. Athaliah heard everyone shouting and clapping, and she yelled, "Treason, treason!" The people could have answered her, "Yes that was your crime." The wicked often accuse others of the things they are guilty of. They are familiar with the sin because they live it daily, but in their twisted minds they have cleared themselves while accusing everyone else. They are so shocked when justice against them prevails.</p>
<p class="indent">The people may have wondered what happened to the justice of God. As time passed and Joash was aging, the animosity of the people was growing. The selfish reign of Athaliah and her love for Baal was causing the animosity that would erupt in the justice of God. He has His perfect time for everything.</p>
<p class="indent">When we see wickedness prevailing and are accused of the very things our adversary is guilty of, remember, Satan is the accuser of the brethren. God will deal with wickedness when the time is right. The people of the land also tore down the temple of Baal in Judah and killed the priest of Baal. Then they made a covenant with God and with their new king.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: God is not looking the other way. He is laying the groundwork for His will to be done in His perfect time.</p>
