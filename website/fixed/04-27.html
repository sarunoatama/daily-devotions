<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>April 27</h1>
<p>Joshua 10:12-13 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: "O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon." <sup>13</sup>So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Kings of the land gathered to attack the Hivites who had made peace with Israel. Joshua was a man of integrity. He honored the treaty with the Hivites even though it had been made through deceit. The LORD encouraged Joshua to attack the kings and not be afraid. God even caused hailstones to take out the fleeing armies of the kings.</p>
<p class="indent">There were so many soldiers in confusion that Joshua asked God to give him more time. God answered that prayer by almost doubling the hours in that day. This was not a natural phenomenon, and it just cannot be explained. It was miraculous. It was God doing what He had promised to do.</p>
<p class="indent">It was not as though the Israelites had been perfect. This whole battle was due to not consulting the LORD. But their heart was right with God. They recognized their mistake and were obedient. This time God's instruction was to go and defeat the enemy. God took a bad situation and used it to give them a one-day victory over five kings, expediting their victory over the land.</p>
<p class="indent">Because you made a mistake in the past that has consequences today does not mean the LORD can't use it for your good. Listen to Him today. Obey Him today and watch what looks like a problem turn to a blessing when God fights for you.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: If your heart is right with God, He can even turn mistakes into victories.</p>
