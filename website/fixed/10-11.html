<p>Psalms 46:4-5, 10 (NIV) <i><sup>4</sup>There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. <sup>5</sup>God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>10</sup>"Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jerusalem is the city of God. It was the place God chose to dwell. His manifest presence was in the Temple behind the veil. Jerusalem is a shadow of the reality, the true city of peace, the people of God. He dwells in the hearts of His people, behind the veil of their physical bodies.</p>
<p class="indent">In Jerusalem there is no river. There is a valley where the Kidron flows when there are rains. The water for the physical city comes from an ancient well and from rain collected in cisterns. But in the real city of God there is a river. It springs up from the source. Isaiah foretold of this watering that would come from God and turn into an overflowing spring (Isaiah 58:11). He also foretold that when God's people listen to the Word, their peace would be like a river (Isaiah 48:18). Jesus stood in the Temple during a feast and invited all who were thirsty to come and drink from Him and experience streams of living water flowing from within them (John 7:37-38).</p>
<p class="indent">The city with such an abundant source of water is safe against the siege of the enemy. It will not fall. We will find God to be our help when the enemy attacks. And where do we find this water that makes us glad? Where is this Living Water to be obtained? "Be still, and know that I am God." Wait in His presence to hear the words of Life that He would speak to you. When you do, drink deeply, and accept the peace and comfort that they bring. Know He is God over all, and that nothing escapes from His sight.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Our conditions and our hearts are completely visible to Him. He will deal with the enemy in His perfect time, at the break of day. Be still, and know that He is God!</p>
