<p>Leviticus 19:2 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>"Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: 'Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Holy: unmixed, pure, undefiled, set apart for one use, not for common usage. All these terms are used for the word 'holy'. Of all God's attributes, this is the one that seems to draw from creation the most reverential awe. The special beings of praise fly around the throne singing, "Holy, holy, holy!" As they do, all those around the throne, men and angels, join with them, in awe of His holiness.</p>
<p class="indent">What is God commanding us to be? Fallen man is so polluted with desire for the temporal and self-appeasing pleasures. God is telling everyone that this is not His plan for man. God wants to commune with us and the Holy will not commune with the vile. There must be a change so that we can enter into that relationship God desires to have with us. All the rituals in Leviticus are painting pictures of how God will one day bring it about through the sacrifice of His only Son.</p>
<p class="indent">The reason that we are to be holy is so that we can come into communion with Him. But that is not the only reason. The main reason is the one stated here, "...because I, the LORD your God, am holy." A thing is right or wrong because it is consistent or inconsistent with the perfection of God. All that is good is truly good because it is like the goodness of God. All that is genuine love is like the love of God, who is pure and perfect Love. You should be gracious toward others in the same way God is gracious toward you. The same is true of all His attributes. You, as His people, are expected to reflect His character, including His holiness. Be holy BECAUSE He is holy.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Is there something in my life that I must forsake to be more like God?</p>
