<p>Lamentaions 3:22-24 (NIV) <i><sup>22</sup>Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. <sup>23</sup>They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. <sup>24</sup>I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him."</i></p>

<p class="indent">The book of Lamentations is Jeremiah's woeful song about the destruction of Jerusalem. What once was the joy of the whole earth became a smoldering pile of ruin. The roads would no longer be full of joyful pilgrims heading to the appointed feasts of the LORD. The priests would no longer offer the daily sacrifices. Their world had come to an end because of their insistence on idolatry. Even the remnant that remained rejected the warning of Jeremiah and went to Egypt where they offered incense and baked cakes to the Queen of Heaven. They insisted the problem was that they had forsaken her, not Jehovah. Most scholars believe the remnant finally killed Jeremiah in Egypt for constantly warning them about impending judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">In the midst of Jeremiah's song of woe, he reminds us that even though all seems lost, it is only because of the LORD's great love that we are not consumed. The creatures are rebelling and insulting the One who made them and who carefully laid out guidelines for their good. It is amazing that He doesn't instantly vaporize them, but His compassions never fail. Every morning His compassion is renewed, hoping that we will turn back and restore our relationship with Him. Could there be a more faithful God? Why would we turn to any other?</p>
<p class="indent">Jeremiah declared that His portion, his inheritance, his appointed part in life, was the LORD. He wasn't looking for wealth or power or fame. He just wanted the LORD. Therefore, he determined to wait in expectation (hope) on Him. He wasn't looking for anything in this life as a goal. The LORD was his goal.</p>
