<p>Deuteronomy 6:23 (NIV) <i><sup>23</sup>But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land that he promised on oath to our forefathers.</i></p>

<p class="indent">All through the wilderness wondering, the people complained that God had brought them out to let them die in the wilderness. Someone had their ear. Does someone have yours? God's intention is to bring you out of the world to bring you into fellowship with Him. The Israelites kept complaining that God was going to let them die in the wilderness. They feared never making it. That was the worst of both worlds. They couldn't enjoy Egypt nor could they enjoy the Promised Land. All they had was the Desert wandering. When they finally were ready to go in, they had such a lack of faith in God's ability to conquer their enemies that they requested dying in the desert.</p>
<p class="indent">The Apostle Paul wrote that if we have no hope of resurrection, if all we have is here, eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die. In other words, if this desert wandering is all we have, lets go back to Egypt. In today's verse God declares that His whole purpose in bringing us out is to bring us in. It is not to take away pleasurable things. It is to give you real pleasures (Psalm 16:11).</p>
<p class="indent">God will finish the work He started when He first drew you to Himself. He will change you into His image (Romans 8:29). He will bring you into the Promised Land of unbroken fellowship with Him. We struggle with all the distractions of life and wonder if we will ever get there. He brought you out to bring you in! Don't get comfortable in this desert, pilgrim.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: He has brought you out to bring you in. Are you entering in?</p>
