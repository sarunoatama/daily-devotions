<p>Psalms 105:5 (NIV) <i><sup>5</sup> Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,</i></p>
<p>Psalms 106:12-13 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>Then they believed his promises and sang his praise. <sup>13</sup>But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.</i></p>

<p class="indent">How soon we forget. God is always working in our lives. At times it is very evident. There is no way to deny it. That is when we believe Him, and doubt is the furthest thing from our minds. We sing a song of praise. We make vows that we intend to fulfill.</p>
<p class="indent">We should believe without the miracles, or seeing His hand against our enemy. We should know He is capable of healing, even if He chooses not to. But we are weak and easily swayed by our circumstances. When the miracle is fresh, when the healing has occurred, then we are totally convinced. But we soon forget.</p>
<p class="indent">We are no different than the Children of Israel who sang praise for an incredible rescue one day, and murmured and whined the next. What is wrong with us? We have a sin nature! What can we do about it? We take the sin nature to the cross, but we so readily take it back up again. God tells us to remember what He has done. Keep a journal. Flag those days in which God moved. Review those times when His presence was so real that you could touch Him. Write down the words He spoke to your heart and review them often.</p>
<p class="indent">When Joshua led the Children of Israel across the Jordan at flood stage, the LORD had him make a memorial mound of stones. When someone in the future asked about that pile of rocks, they were to tell them about the mighty power of God that stopped the river at flood stage so that all could cross. You probably need to make a few memorial mounds to remind you of the Jordans God parted for you. Pass on to your children and grandchildren the things God has done in your life. Leave a written legacy of the mighty works of God. Most will not care much about the details of your life, but reading about God's intervention in your life will give them hope and faith to see Him working in their life.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember the mighty works of God. It will keep the fire in your heart stoked. It will inspire future generations.</p>
