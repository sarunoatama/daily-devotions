<p>Matthew 25:8-10 (NIV) <i><sup>8</sup>The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.' <sup>9</sup>"'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.' <sup>10</sup>"But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. </i></p>

<p class="indent">During the week before the crucifixion, Jesus told several parables about His return to the earth. Our passage today is from the parable of the wise and foolish virgins. Five had brought plenty of oil. Five did not bring enough to last until the groom came for them. While they were waiting, the foolish virgins ran out of oil. They asked the wise virgins to share their oil, but they sent them to buy more for themselves. While they were away buying oil, the groom came. The five wise were let into the marriage banquet, and the others were locked out. When they knocked on the door, the groom replied that he did not know them.</p>
<p class="indent">The expression of not knowing someone is found earlier when some try to enter heaven (Matthew 7:22-23). In that passage, Jesus says they never fed, clothed or visited Him in jail. He was referring to things done to the least of His brothers as being the same as doing it to Him. Comparing these two teachings we could relate the oil to a life yielded to the Holy Spirit. He is the One who sheds light upon our path. The Scripture makes the simile of oil and the Holy Spirit. Some lives are so yielded to the Spirit that they serve God continually without even consciously being aware of it. Their thoughts are set upon the desire of the Spirit and controlled by the Spirit (Romans 8:5-6). You can't give that to someone. Each of us must individually seek that from God.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the parables of the return of Christ imply that He will come at a time that no one suspects. Many will be taken off guard, while others will be waiting expectantly. Are you waiting? Is your life full of oil? Continue to ask for more of your life to be filled with the Holy Spirit, available to serve others at His leading.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Whether we live to see His Second Coming or die before that event, we should live every day as if it were our last.</p>
