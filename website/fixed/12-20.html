<p>Jeremiah 33:2-3 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>"This is what the LORD says, he who made the earth, the LORD who formed it and established it&#8211;the LORD is his name: <sup>3</sup>'Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.'</i></p>

<p class="indent">Are you in turmoil about a situation in your life? Is it hard to understand the reasons and purposes God has for you at present? Does it seem that God has removed His hand from your circumstances? Ask the Creator who formed you. Go to the One who knows all things and has all things in His hands. Listen to His word as He speaks to you. It declares that He works all things together for good to those who love Him, who are called according to His purposes. (Romans 8:28)</p>
<p class="indent">Call out to Him and He will answer. He doesn't say He might. He doesn't say when, but He will answer. Our problem is that we cannot see all the factors and events of the future. They are all present before God. They are unsearchable to us, but they are the work of His hand. Your loving Father invites you to ask Him. He will not reveal them to us unless we ask. He will reveal parts of His great plan, and we will see parts of the great puzzle of life fall into place.</p>
<p class="indent">His revelation will not always give us complete understanding, but it will give us peace knowing He is on the throne of heaven, ordering all things, and working out all things for our good. He is always at work. Watch for His hand. When things don't make sense, call out to Him.</p>
