<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>May 5</h1>
<p>Luke 8:16-18 (NIV) <i><sup>16</sup>"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. <sup>17</sup>For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. <sup>18</sup>Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him."</i></p>

<p class="indent">What do you have? Only what you have received. You receive physical things and spiritual things. The physical will perish; the spiritual will last. The physical does not transform the soul; the spiritual does.</p>
<p class="indent">How do you receive the spiritual? It is usually through your ears. In Jesus' day, when many could not read or afford to purchase a manuscript, it was almost entirely through the ears. What do you hear?</p>
<p class="indent">We are familiar with this illustration as it is used in Matthew, or in the song This Little Light of Mine. Those applications are about boldly letting the witness of Jesus in you be seen by others. In this evening's passage, Jesus is using it for either good or evil. Others will see whatever you listen to and absorb. You can't hide what you have become. Listening transforms you. The words go into your mind and heart and affect the way you see the world around you. Cults can transform a person's perspective by merely isolating them from other points of view. That is why Jesus says, "Consider carefully how you listen." He is telling us to consider not only what we listen to, but also how we listen. Do we listen with discernment? Are we sorting through what we hear to discard what is not according to the Word of God, and to cling to that which is of value? Do we sort the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error? That is not to criticize, but to discern what we will receive.</p>
<p class="indent">Why should we take such caution? Jesus is telling us that if we receive what is good, we will receive more of the same. Our light will be visible to all. If we receive vain words, what we have believed to be of substance will prove to be emptiness. People will see our lack of substance.</p>
