<p>1 Chronicles 11:17-19 (NIV) <i><sup>17</sup>David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!" <sup>18</sup>So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. <sup>19</sup>"God forbid that I should do this!" he said. "Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?" Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.</i></p>

<p class="indent">David's mighty men were so committed to him because of the Spirit they saw upon him (see yesterday's devotion) that an expressed desire caused them to risk their lives. Not every desire of an anointed leader is from the Lord. Leaders who have such loyal men must be very careful in what they say to those who support them in ministry.</p>
<p class="indent">David longed for a drink from the well in Jerusalem. These three mighty warriors decided they would battle their way to the well and back to honor his request. When David received the water, he did something that must have broken their hearts. He poured it out to before the LORD. Then he explained why.</p>
<p class="indent">The men had risked their lives for his personal desire. David knew that life was sacred and should only be put on the line for the One who gave life. How could he partake of something those men had risked their lives for? That would cheapen life and put him in the position of God. Later in David's life, he did cross this boundary for a different desire. This passage shows us that he clearly knew where the line was. Devotion to an anointed leader is a good thing as long as that leader is expressing God's desires and not his own. We have the Spirit and must discern which is which.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Can I be as devoted to God's wishes as these men were to David's?</p>
