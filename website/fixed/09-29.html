<p>Psalms 19:7-9 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple. <sup>8</sup>The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes. <sup>9</sup>The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous.</i></p>

<p class="indent">You are reading this devotion today because you believe God's word is a need in your life. This passage in Psalm 19 gives a picture of what a great need it is. In all this world, there is one perfect thing, the word of God. It revives our soul. When you are downcast and need to find hope, the word of God is the source of hope. It will revive your soul. If you are a simple trusting soul, where should you turn? The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy. Man will always disappoint. Not one man, other than Jesus, has completely trustworthy counsel.</p>
<p class="indent">Where can you go for true joy? Happiness will come and go, but the truth of God's promises to you will give you an inner joy that will endure all circumstances of life. If you need clarity to see the way things really are, you need the radiant light of the Word. It illuminates the motivations of men. It illuminates the motivations of our own hearts. Without the Word of God our hearts would easily deceive us. The Word shines the light of truth on our thoughts and reveals whether they are from, our flesh or the Spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom. In the Word we see the just judgment on those who turn from God and rebel against Him. We see the treachery of and cunning of man's own heart. The fear of our just God keeps us from playing around with the idea of compromising with sin. Every word of God is pure. You can trust every verse to be completely righteous. Sometimes our carnal mind gets confused by expressions in the Word. We struggle to accept what is written. But if we dig deeper, we will find every word to be altogether righteous. Where else could you go to find all these wonderful things? The man or woman who does the same for you, is a man or woman full of the Word of God. They have had their mind renewed by the Word of God.</p>
