<p>Genesis 1:31 (NIV) <i><sup>31</sup>God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning&#8211;the sixth day.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">God made everything very good because He is good. The psalmist tells us, <i>You are good, and what you do is good; </i>Psalms 119:68a (NIV). Man was placed in a perfect environment with all that he could possibly need. Evil did come into the world and ruin this ideal setting. When we deliberately block the light, there is darkness. The darkness is not a thing in itself, but the absence of light. In our world man is all too ready to blame God for the darkness, for evil. But we see that, from the beginning, all God made was very good. If we recognize that good is from God and the evil (darkness in the world) is the result of turning from Him, we would not be so quick to blame God. How it would change our attitude toward our daily circumstances if we believed God's intentions and plans for us are good!</p>
<p class="indent">If we truly believe that, we would strive to be in the Light and walk in His plans for us. How is it that we are so easily led to think that we have a better idea or plan for our lives than God's? Are you avoiding some good thing God has for you? It is not always easy, but it is good, very good. Enjoy the good things of creation in moderation, and live in all the good that He has planned for you. <i>For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</i> Ephesians 2:10 (NIV)</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Help me to see Your goodness in everything You bring into my life.</p>
