<p>2 Chronicles 16:7-9 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: "Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand. <sup>8</sup>Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen? Yet when you relied on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand. <sup>9</sup>For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Asa was one of the good kings of Judah. He restored the Temple and encouraged the nation to return to the worship of Jehovah. While he was earnestly working on the Temple, God gave him peace for ten years. When an enemy finally did come to attack, he relied upon God and completely defeated them. He had set his heart to seek the LORD.</p>
<p class="indent">After Asa had reigned 35 years, the king of Israel, Baasha, began to fortify cities along the border. This was indication that he was preparing for war. Instead of seeking God as he had done earlier, he took the treasures from the Temple and bribed the king of Aram to break his treaty with Israel. The tactic was successful in that Baasha gave up his plan to attack Judah. It was not a success in the eyes of God who sent Hanani the seer with these words of instruction. Had Asa forgotten how God helped him when he was small and unsure of himself? God is always searching the earth to find hearts fully committed to Him. Those are the hearts He strengthens.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes we attain immediate success, but because we did not do things God's way we end up with long-term problems. Asa later came down with a disease in his feet. He would not seek God for that either, but only sought help from the doctors. That resulted in his death. Asa's legacy was a good one, but it would have been even better if he had stayed dependent on God.</p>
<p class="comment">As God blesses your life, recognize that strength is from Him. Stay fully dependent on Him.</p>
