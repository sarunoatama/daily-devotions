<p>Jeremiah 14:13-15 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>But I said, "Ah, Sovereign LORD, the prophets keep telling them, 'You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.'" <sup>14</sup>Then the LORD said to me, "The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries and the delusions of their own minds. <sup>15</sup>Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name: I did not send them, yet they are saying, 'No sword or famine will touch this land.' Those same prophets will perish by sword and famine.</i></p>

<p class="indent">There will always be false prophets among us. It was a problem throughout the Old Testament. The comparable problem in the days of the New Testament is the false teacher (2 Peter 2:1). They preached the delusions of their own minds, just as the prophets of old spoke the delusions of their minds. The church is plagued by these characters today. Every time one of them gives a time frame or a date, carefully note it on the calendar along with their prediction. When they prove not to be true, you know they are sharing their own delusions.</p>
<p class="indent">They seem to have a supernatural insight into what you want to hear, so it is enticing to believe them without question. The Apostle Paul warns us to weigh carefully what is said (1 Corinthians 14:29). If it is appealing to you, take extra caution. If it exalts you, if it causes you to consider yourself above others, red flags should go up. False prophets know how to appeal to your ego and insecurities.</p>
<p class="indent">By their fruit you shall know them (Matthew 7:20). Are they willing to share their life of sacrifice and service, or are they greedy for gain and honor. Are they secret about their use of their time and finances? A servant will be like his Master. Are they like Jesus or are they cunningly like the Deceiver? They are storing up wrath for the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: If they do not speak according to the Word, there is no light in them.</p>
