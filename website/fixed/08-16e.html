<p>Romans 8:37-39 (NIV) <i><sup>37</sup>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup>38</sup>For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup>39</sup>neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i></p>

<p class="indent">We are not told that we will escape hardship, famine, danger and sword, but that in those difficulties we will be more than conquerors through Jesus. The spiritual battle that is manifested in the physical is Satan's tool to cause us to turn from Christ, but God uses it to cause us to be more dependent on Him. Through the One that loves us, we don't just end up victorious, but even more than that, we are increasingly transformed into the image of the Son.</p>
<p class="indent">Can anything separate you from His love? Paul was convinced that nothing could, and he should know. He went through shipwreck, beatings, scourgings, lack of food, abandonment, and much more. Look what he lists here: death, life, angels, demons, present, future, any powers, height, depth, or anything else in all creation. That about covers it. If God is the Creator and is determined to love you, why would anything He made be able to separate you from His love?</p>
<p class="indent">What a sense of security the believer should have! If God didn't spare His own Son to express His love to you, what could you possibly fear? We should be as convinced as the Apostle Paul. In that conviction, we should rest secure, free from condemnation and worry about tomorrow and eternity. When you are convinced of so great a love, you find personal worth in it, peace, comfort, and joy unspeakable and full of glory. There is nothing that love will not see you through!</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are you convinced? If not, look again at the cross. Then, ask yourself if there is anything He will not see you through.</p>
