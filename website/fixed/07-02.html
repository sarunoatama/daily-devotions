<p>2 Kings 3:15 (NIV)<i>But now bring me a harpist." While the harpist was playing, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha</i></p>

<p class="indent">Elisha became the prophet in the place of Elijah. The king of Moab rebelled against Israel and refused to pay tribute, so the king of Israel, Joram, asked for assistance from the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom. They tried to make a sneak attack through the desert but ran out of water. Jehoshaphat suggested inquiring of a prophet of God, and Elisha was called.</p>
<p class="indent">Elisha told Joram he should inquire of the gods of his parents. Out of respect for the presence of the king of Judah, he did inquire of God. It is interesting to note how he went about hearing from God. It is a theme often repeated in the Old Testament. He asks for a harpist. Remember it was David's harp playing that set Saul free from the oppressing spirit that troubled him. David had assigned instrumentalists to play in the Temple. It seems that Elisha needed music to quiet his spirit that he might hear from God.</p>
<p class="indent">The gift of music is, indeed, a spiritual thing. It can draw us to God and still our spirits. We need to be cautious as to the type of music we listen to. When you need to hear the voice of the Spirit to direct you, you might consider listening to something that was written to the praise of God. He inhabits the praises of His people.</p>
<p class="indent">Music that was written to the praise of man or worldliness can have the opposite affect on us. It can stir our flesh in the direction of the suggestions in the lyrics. It seems that everywhere we go we are bombarded with "popular" music. Most of it promotes illicit relationships. Choose your music wisely and have a good collection of music that is written to the praise and glory of God.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: When you are troubled, tune everything else out and praise the Lord in song. You will find the Lord brings the answers to the troubles that face you just as He did to Elisha.</p>
