<p>Exodus 17:12-13, 16 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up&#8211;one on one side, one on the other&#8211;so that his hands remained steady till sunset. <sup>13</sup>So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>15</sup>Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The rod of God was in Moses' raised hands. To the Israelites, this was one of the many pictures that symbolized the power of God with them. The rod had been the instrument of destruction for Pharaoh's army. It became like a banner to them, like a flag carried before them into battle. It constantly encouraged them that the LORD was present.</p>
<p class="indent">We need the same kind of encouragement as we go into battle, especially when it is a hard fought battle. We find the LORD Himself to be our banner. His promises to be with us encourage us, if we keep our eyes on them. But like Moses, there are times when we are physically or emotionally exhausted. It is just plain hard to keep holding the banner high. We need an Aaron and a Hur to come alongside us and help hold our hands up. That is one reason God placed us in a spiritual family. Who do you go to? It is usually those that the LORD has brought beside you at that particular time. It varies through the years so that we do not take our eyes off the banner and place them on one of these helpers.</p>
<p class="indent">Jehovah Nissi , the LORD is my banner. If your life has been dedicated to Him, then He is your banner as you go into the battles of life. You know He will be with you. When you grow weary, look around, for He has surely brought along some brother or sister to help hold the banner high until that battle is over. Since we are in a covenant relationship with Him, our enemies are His and His are ours. If God is for us, who can be against us?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Who has God placed around me to help me hold the banner high? Whose hands do I need to hold up?</p>
