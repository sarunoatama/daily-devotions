<p>Deuteronomy 31:23 (NIV) <i><sup>23</sup>The LORD gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: "Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you."</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">God commanded Joshua to be strong and courageous. It is repeated so many times in Scripture that I wonder if he was a fearful person. Often God chooses those who must act against their natural inclinations to show that the anointing and power is from God. Certainly he was confident in God, for he and Caleb were the only ones from the previous generation who had the faith to take on the giants.</p>
<p class="indent">We can take this commandment as if it were spoken to us. We, too, lead others into the Promised Land. Anyone that is on the pilgrimage and looking for their heavenly home is in someway leading others into that land. That is God's desire for us so that we can know He will be with us also.</p>
<p class="indent">The promise of God to be with Joshua must have given Joshua great confidence. He had seen how God had helped Moses and worked through Moses to lead the people. If God could do that through Moses who was afraid he couldn't speak well, certainly he could do it through Joshua.</p>
<p class="indent">And what about you? If you know God is with you as He has been with others you know of, those who have gone before you, doesn't it inspire your confidence that He will see you through also? <i>"I myself will be with you." </i>Could we hear a more comforting expression? It should inspire us to heed the command to be strong and courageous.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The call to strength and courage was not a request. It was a command.</p>
