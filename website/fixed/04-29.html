<p>Joshua 21:44-45 (NIV) <i><sup>44</sup>The LORD gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their forefathers. Not one of their enemies withstood them; the LORD handed all their enemies over to them. <sup>45</sup>Not one of all the Lord's good promises to the house of Israel failed; every one was fulfilled.</i></p>

<p class="indent">In the eyes of the people, God had provided everything He had promised them. He had given them rest from their enemies. He fought for them and gave them victory. Is it any different for us today? Will the LORD fight your battles for you and keep all His promises to you? Absolutely! You can count on it. It may not always be in the way you imagine or be without battles. Battles are good for us.</p>
<p class="indent">In the history of Israel, this period seems to be their most faithful period. These years of battles and victories seem to have the least amount of compromise and murmuring. Does that tell us anything? We wonder why life seems to be so full of struggle. Perhaps we would be worse off if we had no battles before us to keep us on our knees, asking for God's help.</p>
<p class="indent">We often wonder if we will ever see the end of conflict, a time when the battles are over, and we can rest. Yes, it is coming. The LORD will give us rest, but not in this life. Oh, you will have breaks between battles, but we need the battles to grow and move forward. We need to keep taking the land as long as we are here. When there was no external enemy to fight, Israel's history showed that they turned inward and lost the spiritual battles with idolatry and being discontented. Thank God for the battles. Keep taking the land. In God's time you will have rest on every side.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help me appreciate the battles, knowing they are for my eternal good.</p>
