<p>Hebrews 11:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. <sup>2</sup>This is what the ancients were commended for. <sup>3</sup>By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Faith, it is a difficult thing to describe. The Bible's definition is to be sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. This chapter in Hebrews goes on to give us numerous examples of faith demonstrated in the lives of people in Scripture. The introduction to the chapter says that the possession of this sureness and certainty is what made the lives of the saints commendable.</p>
<p class="indent">We often think that great deeds done are the reason that God would approve of a life, but this passage says it is the source of the deeds, faith. One could have faith and not have opportunity to express it, such as the thief on the cross next to Jesus. In most cases, faith expresses itself in unusual action that the world considers crazy or worthless. What has your faith motivated you to do that made no sense to the world? What is it motivating you to do today?</p>
<p class="indent">The first illustration of faith is creation. How was the universe formed? Honest science says there is more than the forces we understand at work. Faith simply reads the Word of God and declares that God said it and it was. Science must declare matter to be eternal for it is a "scientific" fact that nothing comes from nothing. Faith says matter came from the Creator. Which takes more "faith"?</p>
<p class="indent">If everything you see was formed at God's command, what does your faith tell you of the hope of sanctification and heaven? Is it any easier for God to speak universes into existence than it is for Him to bring you to heaven perfected in body, soul, and spirit? (1 Thessalonians 5:23) Faith declares, "God said it, and I believe it." It is being sure of our hope, and certain of what we can't see. God can finish the work He started, crowning His creation with purified believers.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, increase my faith. Help me have the certainty that You will finish the work You started in me.</p>
