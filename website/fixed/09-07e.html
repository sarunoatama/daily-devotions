<p>2 Corinthians 3:6,17-18 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant&#8211;not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>17</sup>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. <sup>18</sup>And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit </i></p>

<p class="indent">In this chapter, Paul shares a comparison of the fading glory of the old covenant and the surpassing glory of the new covenant that transforms the hearts of men. He has asked, "Who is up to the task of spreading the fragrant knowledge of Christ?" Then He says that we are, for the new covenant brings the life of Christ that enables us. The Spirit imbues us with His very life. The old regulations just pointed out sin and, therefore, sentences us to death.</p>
<p class="indent">The Spirit is the very presence of the Lord in us! He gives us the freedom to obey His voice and not hard cold rules. He can interpret the Spirit of the Word to us instead of being bound by strict legalistic interpretations. We are free from the chains of regulated behavior to obey the Spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">As we look to the Lord for direction and instruction, we reflect His glory. Instead of the cold, rigid rules, we act in the life giving Spirit. In doing so, we look more and more like Him. The attributes that are His are expressed through us, so that people increasingly see the glory of the Lord in our life, the work of His Spirit within us. The more we look to Him and walk in that communion, the more people see the likeness of Christ in us.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Does this describe your life? Are you being changed with ever-increasing glory? If not, perhaps you are not looking constantly to His Spirit but to the letter. Even in Christianity today there are those who look to hard cold letter instead of the Spirit of the Lord. Let His Spirit interpret the letter in a given situation and point you to the Scripture He would apply. Keep looking to Him expectantly for direction and instruction.</p>
