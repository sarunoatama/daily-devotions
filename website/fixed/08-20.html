<p>2 Chronicles 29:29-31 (NIV) <i><sup>29</sup>When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped. <sup>30</sup>King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped. <sup>31</sup>Then Hezekiah said, "You have now dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the LORD." So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Revival! Hezekiah was the next king, and he began to reign at the age of 25. The very first thing he did was to order the repair and cleansing of the Temple. He saw clearly that all the devastation that the nation had been through was because they had turned from Jehovah to the gods of their neighbors. As soon as the priests had consecrated themselves, they began removing the defiled things from the Temple. In only 16 days, the work was completed. They rejoiced because the work was done so quickly.</p>
<p class="indent">As the priests began the sacrifices, the musicians and singers began to make music. The people all bowed in worship. When the priest had completed the initial offerings, the king and all the people went to their knees. Then the Levites sang the psalms with gladness and bowed their heads in worship. There is a natural progression from songs of gladness and praise to worship and adoration for all that God is. Through worship, the people had dedicated themselves to God. Once dedicated to God, they could freely bring their offerings. They brought so many offerings that the Levites had to help the priests offer them.</p>
<p class="indent">This revival took place in the same pattern that many revivals have since taken place. One man saw the desperate need and began to make a change. The leaders followed his example of dedication and commitment, and the place of worship was cleaned up of all that defiled it. Now that things are in order, the people follow and enter into worship, dedicating their lives to God. Finally, there is an abundance of gratitude and thanks for all that God is, so much so that there is hardly the capacity to contain or keep up with all that God is doing in and through the people.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Revive us again, O Lord, and let it begin in me!</p>
