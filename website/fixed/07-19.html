<p>1 Chronicles 11:9 (NIV)<i>And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD Almighty was with him.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">In this summary of the reign of David, we are reminded why he continually increased in power. The LORD Almighty was with him. God is all-powerful, and all power comes from Him and returns to Him. Several other passages in Scripture remind us of this spiritual truth. When God is with you, there is increase. Psalms 84:7 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.</i> 2 Corinthians 3:18 (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</i></p>
<p class="indent">The increase in your life will not be in the ways the world counts increase. David's increase in strength was for the eternal Kingdom of God. We find much of our musical heritage goes back to David and his instruments and positions he appointed at the Tent of worship. The Psalms of David have inspired and comforted millions. The world can't see an increase in glory, but your brothers and sisters in the LORD can. This increase is an increase in eternal substance, not in temporal passing things. It is the most valuable type of increase, for it is eternal.</p>
<p class="indent">We run after all kinds of other increase in the world, but the heart that is after God will seek the increase that comes from the presence of the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Is that the kind of increase you are seeking? It is the only kind worth seeking.</p>
