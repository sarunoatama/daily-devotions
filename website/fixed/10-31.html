<p>Psalms 127:1-2 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain. <sup>2</sup>In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat&#8211; for he grants sleep to those he loves.</i></p>

<p class="indent">One of the most repeated messages in the Bible is our helplessness without God. I can build a dwelling. I can create a family. But if God is not in it, all my work is without meaning. It is utterly unproductive. Man has the idea that if he relies on himself, he will surely get things done. The Gospel message tells us that without the LORD we will accomplish nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">We can't even protect ourselves. Unless God is watching over us, we are clear targets for the enemy of our soul. Consider the infant in the manger. If God was not watching over that helpless baby, what chance would he have had of surviving Herod's extermination of every infant in the area? The Destroyer is held at bay by God. We forget to thank God for that daily protection.</p>
<p class="indent">The psalmist speaks of a house and a city. The New Testament gives both of these as an analogy to the church. Today, we have many men building churches. There are formulas that work to gather large numbers of people. Still, if God is not the builder, if the work is the work of man and not the Holy Spirit, we will see it end in vanity. Is the LORD building the church you attend? Is the leadership following the Holy Spirit? Encourage that by letting your household be built by God. Let God build your home by faithfully hearing from God and following through on His leading.</p>
<p class="indent">You can work 18 hours every day. You can put intense effort into something as if all success depended on you, but success comes from the LORD. He doesn't drive His sheep. He calls to them to follow Him. He promises them rest.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are you aware of the fact that success in God's eyes is not dependent on how hard you labor, but on your obedience in the little things? As you obey in the little things, He works out the big issues, and the fruit of that cooperation is eternal.</p>
