<p>Genesis 22:7-8,14 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, "Father?" "Yes, my son?" Abraham replied. "The fire and wood are here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?" <sup>8</sup>Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>14</sup>So Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided."</i></p>

<p class="indent">And God did provide Himself as the lamb, the lamb of atonement that took away the sins of the world. For almost two millenniums the Jewish people asked the same question. Where is the lamb? Where is the One who will satisfy God? Shepherds could not provide the lamb; He had to come from the Great Shepherd. And in the fullness of time, God did provide the Lamb. God the Father and God the Son went together, the two of them, to Mount Moriah.</p>
<p class="indent">Abraham looked forward through time and saw the LORD providing the Lamb of God in that same spot. <i>"On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided."</i></p>
<p class="indent">On that mountain, atonement for you and me was provided. In father Abraham's case, the knife was stopped mid-air, but Father God allowed the knife to fall on the Son He so greatly loved, to bring many sons to glory. God knew the grave could not hold the One who is Life, but that did not lessen the pain of the Son or the Father in that torturous death on the cross. It did not lessen the separation that took place when the sins of the world were placed upon Jesus and the forces of hell were unleashed upon Him. Child of God, God has provided for you a lamb.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Am I living a life of thankfulness for that provision?</p>
