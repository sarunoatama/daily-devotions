<p>Ezekiel 11:19-20 (NIV) <i><sup>19</sup>I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. <sup>20</sup>Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Ezekiel saw another vision of God. The predictions of doom were so dark that he cried out asking if any would survive. The LORD said that He was the sanctuary of those already in exile. There were two separate times in which Babylon came and took people into captivity. He was prophesying in between those times.</p>
<p class="indent">Then the LORD gave him one of the first promises of restoration in Ezekiel. He promised to give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them. God had just shown Ezekiel how corrupt their hearts had become. This was the only hope for them in the future, a new spirit. Their main problem was that their heart was divided between Jehovah and other gods. The only way that can be dealt with is to have a new heart. The heart they had then was too hard. They did not have the tenderness of God's heart toward them. If we could but see how tender and patient God's heart is toward us, it would help to give us an undivided heart.</p>
<p class="indent">The new heart is that of the new creation birthed when we come to Jesus asking for life. He takes out our old stony heart and gives us a heart of flesh. Then, in tenderness toward His Spirit within us, we live the spirit of the Law. We become His children and can call Him our God. Is your heart tender toward His Spirit? Is it divided between Him and the world, like Judah of old? If you recognize it is, ask for revelation of His tender heart toward you. Ask for that miraculous work of a spiritual heart transplant.</p>
