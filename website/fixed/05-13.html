<p>1 Samuel 12:23-25 (NIV) <i><sup>23</sup>As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right. <sup>24</sup>But be sure to fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you. <sup>25</sup>Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Samuel had anointed Saul as king. Shortly after, Saul led them in a great victory. Samuel gave them a sign to help them discern what an evil decision they had made in asking for a king. Then he encouraged them to make the best of their wrong choice by seeing that they and their king serve God.</p>
<p class="indent">In today's passage, Samuel comforts them with the fact that he will pray for them. He says it would be sin for him not to. We often think of sin as an evil action we commit, but it also the good that we should do but don't.</p>
<p class="indent">He also promised to continue to teach them the good and right way. As Christians, we have an obligation to those under our influence, to teach them the good and right way the LORD has taught us. Israel had seen the hand of the LORD in power. Their attitude of fear, in regard to their relationship with God, was a good thing. They realized His might and holiness and their need for instruction.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Be sure to fear the LORD and serve Him faithfully with all your heart.</i> We need that reminder. So many distractions would pull us away from that good frame of heart and mind. Consider the great things He has done for you. That will help you keep a heart of gratitude and put distraction in perspective. Yet if you persist in doing evil, it doesn't matter how great a king you have, God will sweep you and your hero away.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider Calvary, Easter, Pentecost, and your salvation. The LORD has done great things for you!</p>
