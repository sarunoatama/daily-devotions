<p>Colossians 1:15-17 (NIV) <i><sup>15</sup>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. <sup>16</sup>For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. <sup>17</sup>He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Paul had no doubts about the deity of Jesus. He understood that Jesus was the visible manifestation of the invisible God. Every manifestation of God throughout Scripture is Jesus Christ. God is a spirit, but when He is manifested, we are seeing Jesus in some form.</p>
<p class="indent">The place of firstborn is usually given to a firstborn son. Jesus is eternally existent with God, but He was born into the world of creation at a point in time through Mary. The firstborn is the heir of the Father, with a double portion of the inheritance. So, though everything is God's, the double portion of inheritance belongs to Jesus. Our adoption as sons would give us a single portion of the inheritance. What is incredible is that Jesus is willing to share His inheritance with us, considering us His brothers.</p>
<p class="indent">This passage also declares Christ to be the instrument of creation. Everything that was made, everything that exists other than the Father, Son and Holy Spirit was made by Jesus. It was made for Jesus. The rebellion in the Garden only detracted for a moment in eternity, from the ultimate will of God. Everything will glorify the Son. There is no other possible outcome. He holds it all together. At His word it would all cease to exist.</p>
<p class="indent">At times, we forget the supremacy of Christ and grow concerned over our temporal situations. It helps us to go back and look at the big picture and realize that everything is in His hands. Everything will bring Him glory. The whole earth is filled with His glory.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: No matter how powerfully present evil appears to you, it is temporary. One word from Jesus will end it.</p>
