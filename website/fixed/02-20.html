<p>Exodus 32:31-32 (NIV) <i><sup>31</sup>So Moses went back to the LORD and said, "Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold. <sup>32</sup>But now, please forgive their sin&#8211;but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written."</i></p>

<p class="indent">While Moses was on the mountain receiving God's instructions, the people had gone their own way, insisting that Aaron make them a god to lead them. Freed from the bondage of Egypt and now thinking they are free of a moral leader, they threw caution to the wind and gave in to their lusts. While Aaron formed a golden calf from their donated earrings, the people partied wildly.</p>
<p class="indent">God told Moses to get back to the people, for they had already broken the commandments He had just given. God described the people as stiff-necked. In other words, if you call to them, they will not turn their head to hear. They go their own way. God said He will destroy them and begin again with Moses' children to make a nation for Himself, but Moses pled to God with the above prayer. Imagine if Moses had not had such a heart for the people. The nation would be called the Children of Moses, not the Children of Israel. Here we see the real heart of an intercessor. Paul the Apostle had the same burden for Israel. These men shared the heart of their LORD.</p>
<p class="indent">God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that we would not perish. How much are you willing to give of yourself for the lost around you? Pray for a heart for others like Moses and Paul had, and most of all, like our heavenly Father, who is not willing that any should perish.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Do we carry such a burden for those whom God has called? Would we give up our eternity to gain theirs?</p>
