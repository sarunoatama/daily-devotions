<p>John 4:48-50 (NIV) <i><sup>48</sup>"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe." <sup>49</sup>The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies." <sup>50</sup>Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Some folks are desperate for signs and wonders. "Show me and I'll believe," they say. A miraculous sign may help convince the seeking but cautious heart, but it will add to the condemnation of the hardhearted who are looking for excuses. Jesus said, <i>"They have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father"</i> (John 15:24). Many will believe and yet not confess, because they love their lives just as they are (John 12:42-43).</p>
<p class="indent">The royal official may have had some doubts, but he was desperate for Jesus to save his child. He did not let the rebuke deter him. There was nowhere else in which he placed any hope. Jesus spoke the word, and it was done. Remember that whatever your situation, Jesus need only speak the word and it is done. If He doesn't, there is a reason. The solution to every problem is a word from the lips of Jesus, but He will not speak it when He has better things in store for you.</p>
<p class="indent">The man took Jesus at His word. What great faith! What an example for us today! Like the Centurion whose servant was sick, this official knew a word from the lips of Jesus was enough. And yet, when he arrived at home and found his child well, he asked what hour his healing took place. When he found it was the moment Jesus spoke, he and his entire household believed. The miracle convinced his seeking heart. Are you taking Jesus at His word, both His written and spoken word? When He speaks to your heart, do you count it done? When you see the miracle, are you and your household convinced?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The words that He speaks to us are Spirit and life (John 6:63). Hear Him.</p>
