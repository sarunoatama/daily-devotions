<p>Matthew 10:24-25, 28 (NIV) <i><sup>24</sup>"A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. <sup>25</sup>It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, how much more the members of his household! </i></p>
<p><i><sup>28</sup>Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</i></p>

<p class="indent">If you associate yourself with Jesus, prepare your heart to be treated like Jesus was treated. They called Him Lord of the demons. That means they consider His followers to be demons. One of the repeated patterns of Satan (the accuser of the brethren) is to accuse God's people of the very things he is guilty of. It is so common that you can count on it. In making the accusations, they will think they are serving God. We should walk with God in a way that would leave us above reproach, but that does not mean the enemy won't accuse you of what he is doing. You are in good company. The saints before you were accused in the same way.</p>
<p class="indent">The Lord gave us a negative imperative in regards to the fear of men. Don't do it! Do not fear men! All they can do is kill your body. Eternity is incomparable in length to the short life we have on earth. Fear God. Live in respectful reverence to His will. He will judge all men. Live so as to be judged innocent of treachery and rebellion. That may mean that you confront evil in your society, your church and your home. Negative consequences may result from your stand. Don't fear man's response. Fear disobedience to God.</p>
<p class="indent">The way that we conduct ourselves shows which reality we endorse. The fear of man says we believe this world is all there is. The fear of God says we believe in eternity. Your life preaches one message or the other. Those who really believe in a sovereign eternal God, can face anything man can throw at them. They have a holy boldness that shows their eyes are fixed on eternal realities. They see past the present adversity to the glory yet to be revealed. They are partakers of the sufferings of Christ.</p>
