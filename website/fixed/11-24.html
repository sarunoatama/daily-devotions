<p>Isaiah 1:18-20 (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>"Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. <sup>19</sup>If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; <sup>20</sup>but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Any culture will express the value of their beliefs in the justice and compassion of their social life. Isaiah was prophesying to a culture that went through the motions of religion without sincerity of heart. Though they said they believed in God and justice, they lived lives that denied that claim. Greed was the driving force of the nation. Scales were not accurate. Justice was determined by bribery. The weak and poor were taken advantage of.</p>
<p class="indent">God allowed the enemies of Judah to rob and defeat them over and over again so that they would turn back to Him. They would turn back for a brief period and then would go right back to their idols that promised them the prosperity their greed desired. Still, God's arms were open to them, and His voice called out to them to repent.</p>
<p class="indent">Your life expresses the value of your beliefs just as that culture expressed the heart of the people. In every action that God is dishonored, there is some kind of idolatry in our heart. God calls to us just as He called to them. Sit down with Him. Reason together with Him. He is willing to cleanse you and help you if you are willing. If you continue to be willing and obey what He shows you, then you will find the goodness of God in your daily life. If you rebel against His instruction, your sin will eventually destroy you.</p>
