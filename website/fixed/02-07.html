<p>Exodus 15:2-3 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him. <sup>3</sup>The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Israelites are now praising again. The enemy is washing up on the shores, and they are freed. But are they? They have escaped the land, but the system and ideas of Egypt are not yet out of them. The enemy army is dead, but the nation of Egypt will rise again and harass Israel. This is a perfect picture of us when we are delivered from sin. We are out of the world (positionally), but the Spirit of God will continue to get the world out of us through our experiences in life as we walk with Him (experientially).</p>
<p class="indent">They have learned that the LORD is their strength, though when they get to the border of the Promised Land, they will think they are not strong enough, completely forgetting this lesson. May the LORD help us remember that He is our strength!</p>
<p class="indent">He is our song! The joy that bubbles up in melodies of praise is the LORD. He is the song on my lips and in my heart. He is my joy, for He has become my salvation. Who is my salvation? Jesus! He has freed me from my enemy. He defeated death, hell, and the grave. That should always be our song and praise, as we exalt the One who has done for us what we could not do for ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">The mightiest Warrior is with me. Why should I fear an enemy? If God is for me, who can be against me?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Let the LORD be the song that rises up in you.</p>
