<p>1 Kings 18:17-18 (NIV) <i><sup>17</sup>When he saw Elijah, he said to him, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?" <sup>18</sup>"I have not made trouble for Israel," Elijah replied. "But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the Lord's commands and have followed the Baals.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Elijah has been in hiding for three years. Wicked king Ahab searched the nations for him. The drought was so severe that it was destroying the kingdom. When God sent Elijah to meet with the king, the king called him, "the troubler of Israel" Amazing how the world sees the saint as the evil one. There is a cry in some societies today against "the intolerant Christians". There will always be a cry against the righteous who stand for integrity and truth. As long as you represent the LORD, and hold Him as the standard, the world will hate you and blame you for the troubles that stem from the judgments of God. Elijah had come to bring the mercy of God in the form of rain.</p>
<p class="indent">He set the record straight when he told Ahab that it was he and his family that were the cause of the trouble in Israel. Why? They have abandoned the LORD's commands and followed Baal. If God allowed rain when the people looked to Baal for it, He would be encouraging them to have faith in a lie. The mercy of God withheld the rain. The guilty often point their finger at the very ones who are trying to bring the grace and mercy of God into a situation.</p>
<p class="indent">There are times when a brother will bring us a harsh word. We must determine whether there is validity in it, or if we are being attacked for our integrity. A heart that is soft toward God will soon know the difference. Ahab did not have such a heart. I trust, by the grace of God, you and I do.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord Jesus, help me stand for truth and righteousness regardless of what the world may call me. Help me to bring your grace into a needy world.</p>
