<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>April 26</h1>
<p>Luke 1:51-53 (NIV) <i><sup>51</sup>He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. <sup>52</sup>He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble. <sup>53</sup>He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Today's passage is the rest of Mary's Holy Spirit inspired song upon meeting her cousin Elizabeth. (see April 25 evening) This was an amazing event in history. The woman whose womb holds the forerunner of the Messiah and the last Old Testament prophet had just met her cousin whose womb held the Messiah. They were both filled with the Spirit and uttered prophetic words. Mary's words are believed to have originally come forth as a song.</p>
<p class="indent">In the latter half of the song, we have the passage for today. It is a sweeping view of the work of God. It gives us a principle of the way God works. God is writing history by His mighty acts. Those who are proud, even secretly within their hearts, are scattered. Pride is such an offense to God because He knows how utterly needy and poor man is. Pride denies the true condition of man and the wonder of God. God takes the rulers off their thrones and lifts up the humble. The people who think they have power find that God can take that power from them in a moment. It is the humble that find themselves exalted.</p>
<p class="indent">Near Bethlehem is Herod's incredible structure, the Herodium. Like a giant hill on the landscape, this towering circular structure is an architectural wonder. Underneath it are vast cisterns for water storage. Before it was a giant water arena in which sea battles were performed that included hippos. Surely the King of the Jews would be born in such a magnificent place. No, the incarnate God was born in the shadow of this structure in a little rock grotto. The humble unknown woman from Nazareth, a tiny, despised town in the far north, gave birth to the God-man, Jesus. God lifted up the humble.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness will be filled. They know they are needy. They know God is great. They know He is their only hope. They touch reality. May we all lose our pride in recognition of the reality of our sinful condition and the awesome sufficiency of God.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Your view of this reality will determine whether you go away hungry or filled.</p>
