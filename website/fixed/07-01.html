<p>2 Kings 2:9-11 (NIV) <i><sup>9</sup>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?" "Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit," Elisha replied. <sup>10</sup>"You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah said, "yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours&#8211;otherwise not." <sup>11</sup>As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Elijah had done as the LORD commanded him and called Elisha to be the prophet in his place. The time had come for Elijah to depart this world, and Elisha knew it. He would not leave the side of Elijah even though Elijah asked him to stay behind. He must have known by the Spirit of God that if he stuck close to Elijah he would be blessed.</p>
<p class="indent">When they arrived at the place to which the LORD had led them, Elijah asked if there was anything he could do for Elisha. Elisha asked for a double portion of his spirit. The spirit of a man is his relationship and zeal for God. Elijah left it in God's hands by saying that if Elisha saw him taken from him he would know his request was granted. Sure enough, he saw it happen.</p>
<p class="indent">When Elijah called Elisha, he threw his cloak over him. Now he left his cloak behind for him. When we look through the life of Elisha, we find twice as many miracles recorded as were recorded in the life of Elijah. He did receive the double portion he asked for.</p>
<p class="indent">What would you have asked for? This reminds us of Solomon's request for wisdom to rule. What we ask for depends on the calling the LORD has placed on our lives. The desire behind our request should be that our calling be effective and influential for the sake of the Kingdom of God. If our heart is to serve in the most God honoring way possible, God is willing to grant our request. If our request is to be equipped to please our King, we should expect it to be granted.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: We need to show the tenacity that Elisha showed in not leaving Elijah's side until the LORD equips us for our calling.</p>
