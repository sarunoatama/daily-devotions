<p>Exodus 33:13-15 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people." <sup>14</sup>The LORD replied, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest." <sup>15</sup>Then Moses said to him, "If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Moses had set up a tent where he would go and meet with the Lord. The cloud that led them would come over the tent when Moses went to commune with God. He had a special place he would go. It is a good example for us. We should commune with God throughout the day, but a special place to really hear from God can be helpful.</p>
<p class="indent">After Moses saw the devastation that sin brought on the camp and was reminded about the fallen nature of man, he asked God to teach him His ways so that he would stay in God's favor. Moses was asking to learn to walk in righteousness. He wanted to forsake the ways of man and live in the ways of God, that he might please God. How can he lead if he does not know God's ways? His reminder that the nation is God's people enforces the need to know God's ways. He had already received the Law, but Moses knew it was more than just rules for living.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of giving Moses more rules or a book to study called <i>The Ways of God</i>, He gave Himself. Presence is rightly capitalized here. This is the Prince of the Countenance. It is Jesus going with Moses. That is who is in the cloud as the angel of the Lord. He is the One who meets with Moses in the tent. He is the Way of God. Moses rightly says, "If your Presence does not go with us we don't want to move." I hope you have come to the same conclusion. Sin is devastating. You need to know the ways of God. You need His Presence with you in all you do and everywhere you go.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: If Jesus doesn't go with you, stay put! In Him we find rest.</p>
