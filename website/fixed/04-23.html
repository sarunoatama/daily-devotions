<p>Joshua 5:13-14 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, "Are you for us or for our enemies?" <sup>14</sup>"Neither," he replied, "but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come." Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, "What message does my Lord have for his servant?"</i></p>

<p class="indent">Joshua was ready to go to war, but He needed direction from His commander in chief. As he approached Jericho, he saw this great warrior with sword drawn. "Whose side are you on?" he asked. "Neither!" came the reply. This is none other than Jesus. He appears a number of times in the Old Testament. These appearances are referred to as Christophanies. Notice that in the following verses He told Joshua that he was on Holy Ground, just as the I Am told Moses at the burning bush.</p>
<p class="indent">Whose side is Jesus on? Jew or Gentile? Neither! He is not willing that any should perish. The Canaanites would die because of their iniquity and the devastating pain they were inflicting on one another and their own souls. Their cup of iniquity was full. That does not mean that God did not desire for them to repent, or that He is only for Israel. Rahab and her family were about to be spared. They were the only ones that were receptive to the God of Israel. This Warrior is on her side. He is on the side of anyone of any nationality, in any place and any time, who is willing to receive the truth.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: When we are confronted with the Commander we should do as Joshua did. We should ask, with great reverence, what message our Lord has for His servant.</p>
