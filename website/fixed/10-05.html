<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>October 5</h1>
<p>Psalms 30:5, 11-12 (NIV) <i><sup>5</sup>For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>11</sup>You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, <sup>12</sup>that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give you thanks forever.</i></p>

<p class="indent">It is interesting to note that David wrote this psalm for the dedication of the temple, which he knew would happen after his death. He so longed for the completion of a house for God and a permanent place for people to worship Him, that he made every preparation he could before he died, even the songs to be sung. Do we have such a desire for the spiritual house of God?</p>
<p class="indent">In this song David reminds us that our God given afflictions are very brief, but God's favor lasts all our life. We may cry through the night, but God brings us joy the next morning. Whatever trial we are facing, it helps to remember this truth. Some trials seem long, but in the light of eternity and the favor of God upon our lives, they are fleeting. The Apostle Paul had a thorn in his side for years. It caused him to depend upon the grace and strength of God. This is quite different from dealing with the consequences of our sin. It is the condition of living in a fallen world.</p>
<p class="indent">God turns our wailing into an exuberant dance of joy. He takes the sackcloth of mourning from us and gives us a robe of joy. Know that on the other side of every trial there will be times of joy again, not just happiness, but heart filled joy. Why does He do this for us? It is so that we may sing to Him for His goodness to us, and thank Him for the lessons learned. We thank Him for walking through that Valley of the Shadow of Death with us.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: We will give thanks to God forever for His favor upon us, for sharing His victory with us, and for filling us with His enduring joy.</p>
