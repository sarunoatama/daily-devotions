<p>Deuteronomy 30:6 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live.</i></p>

<p class="indent">In the April 3<sup>rd</sup> devotion we looked at Deuteronomy 10:16. There the Lord commanded us to circumcise our hearts. Here, He says that He will circumcise their hearts and that of their descendants. This expression comes after the Lord promised to return them from the lands to which they were driven. I believe we have yet to see this fulfilled. We have not seen an Israel sensitive to God, but one over whose faces a veil has been placed. But in our day we have seen another return to the Land. Is the time approaching in which the times of the Gentiles will be over and the time for the Jewish people to have their hearts circumcised by God to begin?</p>
<p class="indent">As we wait and watch, we should allow God to do that work in our hearts. He will make us ever more sensitive to Him if we allow it. That is His desire. He will not do so against our wishes. He waits for our permission to do a deeper work in each of us. It is a deeply personal relationship that is willing to have a love that feels the joys and pains of another. Are you willing to share God's burdens? He shares yours. Are you willing to rejoice at the things that rejoice His heart? If you have His Spirit residing in you, then you already do. Still, you can be increasingly sensitive to His heart.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Invite God to do a deeper work. Take time to share His joys and pains as He does with you. Never be too busy to do so. He is never too busy for you.</p>
