<p>Matthew 12:48-50 (NIV) <i><sup>48</sup>He replied to him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?" <sup>49</sup>Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers. <sup>50</sup>For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Gospel account rarely mentions the family of Jesus after he visited Samaria. After the resurrection there was a change, but during His ministry they did not follow Him. This is the rare exception. Jesus must have been speaking to a packed crowd in a building. His family sent word in that they wanted to speak to Him. Jesus response was not a rejection of his family. He was teaching a deep truth. Family that matters most are those that do the will of the Father in heaven.</p>
<p class="indent">We don't seem to grasp the fullness of that truth today. Our assemblies are more like a place where we get together with like-minded friends than family. There are many exceptions. Small groups tend to grow more family minded. If you are not in a small group of around a dozen, seek one out. Take time in those groups to pray for one another's concerns. Encourage one another to do the will of the Father even when the price is high. Then stand by and support one another.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you consider those who do the will of the Father your mother and brother and sister? It is not that they profess the same mindset, or conform to the same style, or are in the same social class. The unity is built around obedience to God. In that, you share the same Spirit. You share the same experience of walking by faith and not by sight. You share the same struggle with the rejection and misunderstanding of men. You don't even need to share the same culture or language. It is the same love that beats within your heart. You have the same Father and the same desire to please Him, therefore you are brothers, forever!</p>
