<p>Revelation 19:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting: "Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns. <sup>7</sup>Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready. <sup>8</sup>Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear." (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the saints.)</i></p>

<p class="indent">When the systems and governments of man have been judged and are no more, then the Lord God Almighty will reign over mankind. When that happens, there will be a mighty shout in the heavens, <i>"Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns." </i>Praise be to God! The injustices and prejudices of man will cease. It is something we can really rejoice over. God has patiently let us try to run things for millenniums, but we have only shown what a mess we can make. Give Him glory for ending our ways and methods and establishing His righteous reign.</p>
<p class="indent">But there is another reason to lift up a shout of praise. The people of God, who are the bride of Christ, has made herself ready for her marriage to the Lamb. There is that dual work we see throughout Scripture. She has made herself ready. Yet, to her is given a robe of righteousness. Well, which is it? Was it her efforts to follow and submit to the Lordship of Christ, or the robe given her? The robe is her righteous acts, yet it is given her. He prepared in advance good works for us to do. (Ephesians 2:10)</p>
<p class="indent">Rejoice and give Him glory. He is working through you to prepare you for the marriage. He will clothe you in bright, clean, and fine linen. The work He is doing in you will be completed, and you will forever be with the Lord. No death will ever part you two. You may kiss the Son. (Psalms 2:12)</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: The story ends with a marriage to the coming King. Are you getting ready for that day?</p>
