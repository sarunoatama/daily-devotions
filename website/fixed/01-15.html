<p>Genesis 15:6 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Salvation has always been by grace through faith. God reached out to Abram and gave him promises of a son and of possession of the land. God promised his descendents would outnumber the stars, and Abram believed. The apostle Paul wrote, <i><sup>4</sup>Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation. <sup>5</sup>However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.</i> Romans 4:4-5 (NIV)</p>
<p class="indent">He went on to say that this is before the law and before circumcision. Abram had done nothing but believe God, and God credited it to him as righteousness. This shows us that the way to God is simply believing God, not keeping some set of rules or performing some action. It is when we receive what God has said and accept it as truth.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout the ages, man has come to God in the same way. Only the death of the Son of God in our place makes it possible for this transaction. The righteousness credited to us is the righteous life of Jesus. Since God never changes and does not have a different set of standards for different people, we can see all mankind comes to God in the same way. God reveals Himself to man, and man either believes God or turns from God and trusts self. Paul wrote that this grace that brings salvation has appeared to all men. We need not worry that God will be unjust and damn forever those who never had a chance. Creation testifies of God, and the Spirit of God shines on every heart to give them an opportunity.</p>
<p class="indent">This does not let us out of the responsibility of sharing the plan of salvation, for that is the Great Commission. It does, however, show us that God loves the world and is not willing that any should perish.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: All will have an opportunity to do as Abram did, believe the LORD. Do you really believe Him?</p>
