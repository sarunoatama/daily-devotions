<p>Nehemiah 7:2 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most men do.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Once the walls were completed and the gates hung, the enemies of Israel became discouraged because they realized the work was done with the help of God. (6:16) There were still spies within the city who regularly informed the enemies as to what was taking place. They sent letters to Nehemiah to intimidate him, but now the walls are up and so is Israel's confidence in the help of their God.</p>
<p class="indent">Nehemiah assigned his brother Hanani, along with Hananiah, to be in charge of the city. The reason that he was chosen was because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most men. Do you know someone like that? They are careful to obey the law even in areas most people consider unimportant. They are quick to make any offense right with others. They spend time in the Word, but are humble about their knowledge of it. They fear God more than most men do. If you need someone to be trusted in difficult situations, you want this kind of person. You know they won't compromise, for they fear God more than most men do.</p>
<p class="indent">And how about you? Do you fear God more than most? Are you a person of integrity because you know the justice of God, that it is not possible to do wrong and escape His justice in the consequences for evil? You know your sins are covered by the blood of Jesus, but is your sense of His justice still a motivating factor in your life? The Apostle Paul asked if we should sin that grace would look more wonderful by contrast. Of course not! (Romans 6:1,2) Sin still has consequences in this life; God disciplines the children He loves.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: A person of great integrity fears God more than most men do.</p>
