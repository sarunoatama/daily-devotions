<p>Isaiah 57:14-15 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>And it will be said: "Build up, build up, prepare the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people." <sup>15</sup>For this is what the high and lofty One says&#8211; he who lives forever, whose name is holy: "I live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Before a great dignitary of Rome would enter a city, a work crew would go before and make sure obstacles were cleared from the road. Damaged areas were repaired, and washed out areas were filled in. Have you done as much for the Lord Jesus? Is there a cleared highway for Jesus to enter your heart? Does He have a clear path to your heart, desires, and plans? This passage was written to a nation that had idolatry and greed in their "roads", and is applicable to us too.</p>
<p class="indent">The God of eternity, who transcends space and time, who sees and knows all things that ever were and are or will be, is utterly separate from us. He can at the same time be the One who orders all things and yet comes to the hurting soul in need, with a gentle word. Pride holds out a stiff arm to God. Humility and recognition of need draw us to an intimate place with Him. Could pride cause us to go our own way without consulting Him? He promises to live with the contrite and lowly person. It takes humility to say, "I need Thee, oh, I need Thee. Every hour I need Thee!" It takes humility to repent for going our own way.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want the presence of God in your life and the voice of God to renew and encourage, you need a heart that is humble and repentant. Whatever blocks the road, keeping you from that state of heart and mind must be removed.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Check the roadway of your heart. Is it open to our Savior?</p>
