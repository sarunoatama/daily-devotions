<p>Psalms 19:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. <sup>2</sup>Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge. <sup>3</sup>There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.</i></p>

<p class="indent">David looked up at the night sky and saw a declaration of the glory of God. With the Hubble we can see even more wondrous and amazing sights far beyond the range of David's eyes. But we have a different response. We have the audacity to think we have figured God out. Even macro-physicists have to include God in their equations. The more we discover the less we realize we know. Today you will find a majority of astronomers believing there must be a God. One astronomer wrote that to find an argument against the existence of God, he had to go to another department. Yet the average person on the street has the impression that astronomers have it all figured out as a natural process. Let's hope that more astronomers will speak up about their lack of understanding of all that they see so that our perceptions will be corrected.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the sad byproducts of city life is that the stars can barely be seen. Our skies are so polluted that we have hidden the declaration. To replace that effect, we have the pictures from the Hubble continuing to come in as it shoots picture after picture of wonders full of color, design, and phenomena that causes us to wonder. It doesn't need to be translated into French or Russian. It speaks in every language. It displays the knowledge of an infinite Creator who set laws and order and design. When you see those pictures, listen to God.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The heavens are still declaring the glory of God. Are you listening?</p>
