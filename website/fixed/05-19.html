<p>1 Samuel 17:36-37 (NIV) <i><sup>36</sup>Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. <sup>37</sup>The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you."</i></p>

<p class="indent">David had been going back and forth from playing music for the king to tending his Father's flock. His Father asked him to take some food to his older brothers and get their promise that they would share the spoils of war. When he delivered the food, he saw the enemy army send out one giant man who asked for a one on one to determine the outcome of the battle without the two armies clashing. Whoever lost would be servants of the other nation.</p>
<p class="indent">David inquired about the reward for fighting Goliath and spoke boldly that someone needed to kill this heathen. It was reported to King Saul who had David brought before him. David told the king not to worry. He volunteered to fight the giant. The king told David that a boy did not have a chance against a seasoned veteran like Goliath. Then David relayed his experiences of killing a bear and a lion in protection of his flock.</p>
<p class="indent">David had confidence in God because of past victories. He had faith that God would win this battle because this giant was defying the armies of the living God. Experience and faith told David that this lion that threatened God's sheep would be like the lion he had slain defending his father's sheep. You have been given victories in your past to help you have confidence in what God can do today. Mix the experience from your past victories with faith in God's heart and take on the giants of life today.</p>
