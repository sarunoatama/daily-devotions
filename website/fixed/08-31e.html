<p>1 Corinthians 10:31-33 (NIV) <i><sup>31</sup>So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. <sup>32</sup>Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God- <sup>33</sup>even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Christian life is about living for another out of love. I'm referring to the One who died and conquered death that He might be with you. It is an all out, 100%, way of living. In everything that is done, we seek the glory of God, even in the little menial tasks of daily life. It isn't a thing you do on Sunday morning and in the 5-minute daily devotion time. It is your whole life's focus.</p>
<p class="indent">In living for the glory of God, we seek to share Him with others. One thing that must grieve God deeply is when we offend someone who knows we are a Christian. As a representative of Jesus, we have pushed them away from Jesus. That usually takes place because we are selfish and demanding our own preferences. We are being completely inconsiderate of the way they see and understand life and their need to find Jesus as Savior. We please ourselves but give up the greatest privilege we could have, sharing the love of Jesus with them.</p>
<p class="indent">Paul is telling us part of the reason he was so fruitful in his ministry. He did his very best to not to cause anyone to stumble. That does not mean that he compromised the truth. One look at his life tells you that is not the case. But he did consider others' cultures and limited his actions so as not to unnecessarily offend them. He acted for their good and not his own, so that they might be saved.</p>
<p class="comment">Dear reader, remember that you are the only Jesus many will see. Do whatever you can to draw the lost to Christ, not repel them. Their salvation is worth more than any liberty that we might cling to. Take on Paul's motto of trying to please everyone in everyway in order to win them to Jesus. Seek their good over your own that they might be saved.</p>
