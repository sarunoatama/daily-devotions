<p>2 Chronicles 7:11-12 (NIV) <i><sup>11</sup>When Solomon had finished the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the LORD and in his own palace, <sup>12</sup>the LORD appeared to him at night and said: "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.</i></p>

<p class="indent">After Solomon finished praying, fire fell from heaven and consumed the sacrifices. It was a sign that God was involved in all that was done, and it was acceptable as a shadow of the heavenly temple. The glory of the Lord so filled the temple that the priests could not minister. Everyone fell on their faces and worshipped with the words they had sung earlier, "He is good; His love endures forever." Then Solomon sent the people home, and they were full of joy because of all God had done for David and Solomon and for His people. When we know God is at work in our lives for our good, we can be full of joy. When we see He is involved in our leaders' lives, we can be full of joy for we know they will be leading according to His direction.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, when all the festivity was over, the LORD appeared to Solomon. He promised that He had heard the prayer of Solomon. He gave Solomon the assurance that His eyes and ears would be open toward prayers prayed in that place. Even today the Jews claim this promise, praying at the Western Wall.</p>
<p class="indent">God chose that place for Himself as a temple of sacrifice. Almost 1000 years later, on that same mountain, He would present Himself as the sacrifice for the sins of the world. He had indeed chosen that place as a temple of sacrifice. Sometimes, when the LORD speaks, He has much more in mind than we can fathom. His words are always filled with a depth that is beyond our comprehension. We do as He leads, and then He does the impossible and fills our meager labor with greater importance than we can imagine. Then He says, "Well done", as if we had a hand in all the greatness He accomplishes. He is good and His love endures forever!</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Your obedience results in more fruit than you can imagine. Praise God!</p>
