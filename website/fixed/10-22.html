<p>Psalms 91:1, 4 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>4</sup>He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This psalm is a favorite of many people. Contemporary songs have been written with the idea it presents. The idea of being under the wings of God, like chicks under the shadow of a mother hen's wings, runs throughout Scripture. It is a beautiful metaphor full of meaning. We should not look too deeply or make too many analogies from the picture, but a few are quite obviously intended.</p>
<p class="indent">First, we need to seek that nearness to God. A mother hen will give a certain call to her chicks when there is danger, and the ones with any common sense will immediately run for the cover of her wings. God has given us that call in His word. The Devil is like a roaring lion roaming about looking for those He can devour. The call has been given. Are you using your common sense to respond by running for the shelter of wings of the Most High? To dwell (abide) there is really the only safe place to live. We need to experience a constant living there under His shelter. Some refer to this lifestyle as 'practicing the presence of God' or 'abiding in Christ'. It is the one way to live in the rest of God. He has invited us to experience His Sabbath rest, but with the enemy on the prowl, the only way to experience the rest is to live in the shadow of His wings.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several comforting names of God used here. Most High is the Hebrew <i>Elyon, </i>the God above all gods, or Lord of lords. The other is <i>Shadday </i>translated 'Almighty'. This is no ordinary hen. Satan dare not mess with this mother hen. Nothing stands a chance against this One.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Let His wings, His faithfulness, be your protection, your place of rest. Live in His shadow! Abide in Christ!</p>
