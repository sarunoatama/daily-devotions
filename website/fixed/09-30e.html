<p>Ephesians 3:19-21 (NIV) <i><sup>19</sup>and to know this love that surpasses knowledge&#8211;that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. <sup>20</sup>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, <sup>21</sup>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This prayer is continued from the previous day's devotion. Paul was impressed by the Holy Spirit to pray that the believers get a grasp on the dimensions of the love of Christ. Because love begets love, our perception of God's love for us will create in us a love for Him. But Paul says this love surpasses knowledge. It is not just something we intellectually attain. Just because you have a PhD in religious studies does not mean that you grasp the love of Christ. It must come from the relationship of time together and revelation. It is the one thing that will cause us to continue strong to the end. Only love will capture our hearts so that we, in turn, put Him above all else. Paul was making the point that the law could not do that for us.</p>
<p class="indent">The only way to be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God was through a revelation of Christ's love. No formula or rules could produce that change in our lives. Filled to the measure of the fullness of God must come from an intimate relationship with God Himself. Christ in us, communing with us, working through us, is the only way to have that fullness.</p>
<p class="indent">Does that sound impossible? Paul says that it is possible through His power at work in us, because God is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine. Is it hard for you to imagine your life bringing glory to God every day? He can do it! Is it hard to imagine loving Him above all other things in life? A revelation of His love can do it.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Why not take a moment, open your Bible to this passage, and pray verse 16-21 for the people you know that are struggling. Pray it for you and your family. Pray it for your Pastor and elders. The answer to our spiritual struggles is a grasp of the dimensions of the love of Christ for us.</p>
