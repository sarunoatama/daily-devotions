<p>2 Kings 4:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the LORD. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves." <sup>2</sup>Elisha replied to her, "How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?" "Your servant has nothing there at all," she said, "except a little oil." <sup>3</sup>Elisha said, "Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don't ask for just a few.</i></p>

<p class="indent">There are times when a faithful man of God will fall into financial difficulty. It does not mean he has been unfaithful or does not have faith. It is a test of faith. This man that served in the company of the prophets died in debt. His widow was afraid the collectors would take the sons as slaves in payment for the debt. She asked the prophet of God, Elisha, what to do. He had nothing to give her. When he was called by God, he left everything behind and used his yoke for wood and his plow oxen as a sacrifice.</p>
<p class="indent">The man of God asked what she had left. Sometimes we only have a little for God to work with, but He can do a lot with a little. If we are willing to demonstrate our faith by putting that little bit into His hands, He multiplies it. Do you remember the fish and loaves and the widow who fed Elijah? Tell me, what do you have in your house? Come on, voice it! Most of us have plenty. Will we put it in God's hands?</p>
<p class="indent">Elisha tells her to borrow as many jars as she can from her neighbors. Faith takes a big basket to market. Expect God to answer in a big way. She poured the little oil she had left and it kept coming out of that jar. It continued to flow until every last jar was full. If she had a million more, they would have all been full. The miracle stops at the end of our faith. When you expect God to move, prepare in a big way. If God has directed it, you will find you'll wish you had prepared more jars. The oil was sold to pay their debts and provide a pension.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Though the righteous fall into difficulty, God will provide when they place their trust in Him.</p>
