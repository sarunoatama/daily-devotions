<p>James 1:25-27 (NIV) <i><sup>25</sup>But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it&#8211;he will be blessed in what he does. <sup>26</sup>If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup>27</sup>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</i></p>

<p class="indent">James is a very practical preacher. His letter tells us that if the Word does not change us, it is our own fault. He describes the Word as a mirror for our soul. We can look into it and see the ugliness that needs to be changed, or we can walk away and forget what we have seen. The man who continues to look (notice how he switches to hearing) and takes action on what he hears is going to be blessed. Do you want to be blessed? Keep looking into the Word and acting on it. You will be freed from the bondage of sin.</p>
<p class="indent">If you do not continue to look and act on the Word, your life will show it. You may say you are a religious person, but your speech will betray you. Your communication will show that the religion you profess is worthless to you. It is worthless because you have not allowed it to change you.</p>
<p class="indent">Real religion that is acceptable to God is the kind that takes action. It helps those in need, and it keeps you from wallowing in the filth of the world.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Is your religion worthless, or the kind that God accepts as pure and faultless? Are you acting on what you see in the mirror of the Word?</p>
