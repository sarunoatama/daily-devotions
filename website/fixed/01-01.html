<p>Genesis 1:1 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent"><i>In the beginning God...</i> The Bible doesn't argue the existence of God. It does declare that it is the fool who says there is no God. (Psalm 14:1) The very first verse of the Bible begins with His action related to man, the creation of space and matter. That is the logical starting point of creation for an unchanging, eternal God.</p>
<p class="indent">The Bible is a declaration of who God is and His relationship to His creation, man. This first verse tells us that God is before all things and the source of all things. The fact that He alone is responsible for all things should cause us to see that we owe our existence to Him. He is the ultimate standard for what is right and appropriate, for He is the source of all. Have you bowed your head to the One who gave you life and acknowledged that you owe your all to Him? Are you living in the recognition of the fact that <i>"In the beginning God..."</i>? What should that mean to you today and every day?</p>
<p class="indent">Take a moment to think of the One who inhabits eternity before space was spoken into existence. He brought it into being to create a place for you. He didn't need to. He wanted to. Do you want to know Him?</p>
<p class="comment">Admonition: See the world around you today as a gift from the loving hands of your Creator.</p>
