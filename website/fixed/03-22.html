<p>Deuteronomy 5:21 (NIV) <i><sup>21</sup>"You shall not covet your neighbor's wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor's house or land, his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Hello America! Lust will be our undoing. What God has given to another should cause you to be glad for them, not envious. Envy and selfishness are clear signals that we are walking in the flesh (our old nature). To desire to have your neighbor's possession shows you have allowed your heart to become idolatrous (putting a thing before God). What follows is theft, adultery, working on your Sabbath, and ignoring God to get what your heart has fixed itself on.</p>
<p class="indent">Every day commercials bombard us with things to lust after. Advertisers always imply that the possession of the thing will bring you happiness. That has some truth. Things often do bring a shallow and temporal happiness. Things never affect the genuine joy of the heart. Satan said in Genesis 3:5 (NIV), <i>"For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." </i>Satan promises way more than he delivers and never tells you the full price you will pay.</p>
<p class="indent">The Ten Commandments are almost doable until we get to this last one. The problem with man is "his 'wanter' is broken". We should be desiring the truth, things of God, righteousness. Instead, we set our hearts on creations, not the Creator.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Before you go after obtaining anything in life, whether a title, a possession, or a relationship, ask yourself if you expect this thing to bring you happiness. Is it a need or a lustful desire? Will the possession of this thing you seek glorify God or self?</p>
