<p>Psalms 1:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. <sup>2</sup>But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. <sup>3</sup>He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The book of Psalms is a collection of songs of praise. Originally, they came in five different books. Many of them were penned by David. In them, we find expressed the heart cry of man in nearly every situation. No matter what you are going through you can find a psalm that relates to your situation. I turn to them when I am discouraged, for they often begin with complaint and end in praise.</p>
<p class="indent">The first psalm warns us not to keep company with evil people. We are told not to listen to their counsel, stand in their way or sit in their seats. The word 'blessed' is translated 'happy' in some newer renderings. Blessing implies the goodness of God will be with such a person. Look for these beatitudes throughout Scripture. If the Word gives us instruction as to what to do to find God pouring out His goodness on us, we should give careful attention to that instruction. You will be blessed if you avoid bad company. Man has a natural tendency to gravitate toward mocking and complaint. Don't!</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, delight in God's word. Think on it day and night. If you will take some time each day to be in the company of the Word, and let Him speak to you, you will have a thought to dwell on that will build you up instead of tearing you down. Avoiding the mocking sinner and filling your mind with God's instruction will cause you to be blessed.</p>
<p class="indent">In typical Hebrew style, the psalmist expands on what it means to be blessed in a simile. You will be like a tree that bears fruit planted by a stream. You wont dry out. You will prosper in everything you do. What a picture! What a promise! If you believe it, then you should act on it. Take time each day to delight in the Word of God. Take a thought with you through the day.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: "If I meditate on God's Word and don't walk in the counsel of the wicked, whatever I do will prosper."</p>
