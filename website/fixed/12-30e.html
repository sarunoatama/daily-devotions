<p>Revelation 22:3-5 (NIV) <i><sup>3</sup>No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. <sup>4</sup>They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. <sup>5</sup>There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The city is the bride of the Lamb. It comes down out of heaven to the earth adorned as a bride at a wedding. The curse that came upon the world because of sin has been lifted. The world will be a Garden of Eden.</p>
<p class="indent">The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in us, the city. The authority and dominion over the earth will be restored to the descendents of the one who gave up that authority.</p>
<p class="indent">And what will we do? His servants will serve Him. Though we are given authority, we rule as His servants. It is what we should be doing now, serving Christ our King. Sin so often interferes and corrupts our service, but then it will be a pure and holy service.</p>
<p class="indent">We will see His face! Our glorified bodies will be able to look into His eyes. His name will be on our foreheads. Romans sometimes branded the name of the master upon the forehead of a life long slave. When you saw him in the market place you knew who he served. The more important the master, the more you heeded the servant's business. We will have the most important name of all upon our foreheads.</p>
<p class="indent">Darkness will be a thing of the past for us. The Lord who reigns within us will radiate light. All will be illuminated for us. Our eternal reign will have begun.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: This is the destiny of those who are the bride of Christ. A betrothed girl waits anxiously for the day her husband will come and take her as his own. Is this the expectation of your heart?</p>
