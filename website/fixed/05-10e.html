<p>Luke 11:30-32 (NIV) <i><sup>30</sup>For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation. <sup>31</sup>The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here. <sup>32</sup>The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</i></p>
<p class="comment">When the heart of man is stubbornly hard, God will give signs. In Solomon's day, the world was awed at the wisdom and blessing of God upon Solomon. A heathen queen traveled a great distance to hear his wisdom. If that Gentile would make such an effort to learn truth, what should we do when someone greater than Solomon is present?</p>
<p>Jonah was sent to the Ninevites. They were brutal Gentile enemies of Israel. His three days in the belly of a great fish was a sign to them of how much concern God had for them. Someone greater than Jonah came to the Jews of the first century. He gave them a similar but more amazing sign. He lay dead for three days and rose to life.</p>
<p>We could say that this applies to the Jews of the first century. It surely does, but One equally great is here today. The Holy Spirit has been poured out. He is greater than Solomon and Jonah. Are we listening to Him? How far will we go to hear His voice and learn the truth? Are we considering the many signs He gives us? Are we hearing His preaching that brings conviction, encouragement, and comfort? Will the Queen of the South and the Ninevites rise up and condemn us for not hearing and believing, or have we joined their ranks as repentant Gentiles? We will all rise at the judgment on one side or the other.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, give us eyes to see and ears to hear the Holy Spirit in the world today.</p>
