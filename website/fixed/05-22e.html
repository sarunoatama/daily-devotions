<p>Luke 24:27, 31-32 (NIV) <i><sup>27</sup>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>31</sup>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. <sup>32</sup>They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"</i></p>

<p class="indent">After the resurrection, two of Jesus' disciples were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus. As they walked, Jesus came alongside them and asked why they looked so downcast. They did not recognize Him. They asked Him if He hadn't heard the terrible news about the death of their Master, Jesus.</p>
<p class="indent">Then Jesus began with the Law and went on through the prophets teaching them how much was written about the Messiah and what He would endure. They finally understood what redemption really meant. That was probably the best Old Testament survey ever taught. Wouldn't you like to have heard it? (See Jesus in the Old Testament &#8211; <a href="http://www.bible-sermons.org/classes">www.bible-sermons.org/classes</a> or the book, <i>Jesus Concealed in the Old Testament</i>)</p>
<p class="indent">They pleaded with this man to come and join them for supper. When He broke the bread and prayed, they suddenly recognized that it was Jesus. Then He vanished. Did they say, "Wow, He's alive!"? "Did you see Him disappear?" No! Their comment was on the revelation of Scripture. The Word of God was opened to them. They understood things that they had never seen before, and their hearts burned within them. To have the Scriptures opened to us by the revelation of God causes everything to become clear. We see the big picture and our place in it. We are thrilled with the wisdom and sovereignty of God.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, when we open your Word, walk with us, and open our eyes that we might see wonderful things in your law. (Psalms 119:18)</p>
