<p>Isaiah 55:7-9 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts. Let him turn to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will freely pardon. <sup>8</sup>"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," declares the LORD. <sup>9</sup>"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The cry of God is for us to come to Him. This chapter begins pleading for us to come and take the water and bread of life freely. He pleads for us to seek the LORD, and then begins to give this summary of why we need to come to God. We have gone our own way. Man has decided he does not need his Creator. God has graciously directed man in a way that is not self-destructive, but man refuses to walk in it. We are arrogant enough to think we can come up with a better and more satisfying way. That is the same problem Eve had in the Garden. Our lusting eyes and confused mind lead us into a way that is opposed to the way of God.</p>
<p class="indent">Our thoughts that are not yielded to the Spirit of God are the beginning of this downward spiral. God actually wants us to think His thoughts. A life yielded to the Spirit thinks God's thoughts, thoughts in line with the character of God. We cannot keep a thought from passing through our mind, but we can decide not to dwell on it.</p>
<p class="indent">This is God's charge against man: our ways and thoughts are not His ways and thoughts. His are pure. Ours are corrupt. His are good and just. Ours are evil and self-serving. He actually wants us to forsake our ways and thoughts and take in the life of the Son. We are to have the mind of Christ. Does this sound impossible? Jesus died to make it possible for the Spirit of God to live in you.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: If you have received Him, simply let the Word of God live in you richly. His life will shine through you as you walk in His ways and yield your mind to His thoughts.</p>
