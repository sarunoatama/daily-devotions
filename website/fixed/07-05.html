<p>2 Kings 4:32-34 (NIV) <i><sup>32</sup>When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch. <sup>33</sup>He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the LORD. <sup>34</sup>Then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out upon him, the boy's body grew warm.</i></p>

<p class="indent">A wealthy woman asked her husband to make a room for Elisha so that whenever he and his servant came to that town they would have a place they could stay. In return, Elisha asked God to grant her desire to have a son. She was very concerned when he made the promise, because she did not want to have false hopes. Sure enough, a year later she had a son. Don't be afraid to believe that God can bring to pass the desire He has placed in your heart.</p>
<p class="indent">One day the boy had a headache and died. The woman ran to Elisha and told him, "Didn't I tell you not to raise false hopes in me?" Then Elisha knew something was wrong with the boy. He immediately sent his servant to run and lay his staff on the boy while he followed. When the servant laid the staff on the boy, there was no change. There are times when we do what we believe the LORD is directing, but we do not see results.</p>
<p class="indent">Then Elisha went into the room alone with the boy and prayed. If our first leading does not bring results, pray. Ask the LORD what to do next. Apparently, at the LORD's direction, he did what sounds like artificial resuscitation. He did this not once but twice. The first time brought some results, but then he repeated what the LORD had showed him a second time. Then the boy awoke from death.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: If the LORD takes away what He has promised you, trust Him. Even when you have acted at His direction and seen no results, trust Him. Do just what Elisha did. Pray! Ask God what to do next. Then keep doing that until He directs you otherwise or you see the answer.</p>
