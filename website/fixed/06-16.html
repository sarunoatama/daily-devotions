<p>1 Kings 10:8-9 (NIV) <i><sup>8</sup>How happy your men must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! <sup>9</sup>Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the Lord's eternal love for Israel, he has made you king, to maintain justice and righteousness."</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Queen of Sheba had heard of the wisdom of Solomon and his relation to the name of the LORD. We often overlook her interest in Solomon's relationship to the name of the LORD. The LORD's name is the sum of all His attributes. The LORD is all-wise, but He is also faithful, merciful, loving, just, true, holy, etc. She came to see it all in Solomon. All men are a poor reflection, but Solomon was one of the best in the world at that time.</p>
<p class="indent">After spending time asking questions, hearing his answers and seeing the wealth and splendor of his royal court, she burst into the praise of verse 9. Once again, we have an expression of just why it is the LORD bestows His favor. Why did God place Solomon over Israel? It was because of His eternal love for them.</p>
<p class="indent">Has any one ever come to visit with you because of your relation to the name of the LORD? They may have without you being aware of the real reason for their visit. If we are truly walking with the LORD, in His Spirit, the seekers will be overwhelmed too. It is not you they are overwhelmed about, but the LORD whose life is expressed through yours.</p>
<p class="indent">Why has God placed you where you are and doing what you do? It is because He loves the people around you and desires for you to be an example of Him in that environment.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord Jesus, Help me express Your wonderful character in my daily life that others might come to know You.</p>
