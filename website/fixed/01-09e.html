<p>Micah 5:2, 4-5a (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."</i></p>
<p><i><sup>4</sup>He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they will live securely, for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth. <sup>5a</sup>And he will be their peace.</i></p>

<p class="indent">When the Magi came to Jerusalem to ask where the Great King would be born, those who studied the prophesies quoted this verse. They knew the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. Perhaps they thought His ancient origins were in David, or even further back in Abraham. They may have even pondered that His origins were in the King of Salem, Melchizadek, who met with Abraham. But did they guess that His origins were even before time began?</p>
<p class="indent">He was predicted to <i>stand and shepherd His flock in the strength of the LORD. </i>He had certainly brought them spiritual food and drink. (John 6) His answers and miracles showed Him to be standing in the strength of the LORD. The prophecy goes on to say that He would shepherd in the name of the LORD. That means shepherding with the authority of Jehovah. The religious leaders were often asking Him what authority He claimed when He spoke and acted as He did. He not only represented God, He is God!</p>
<p class="indent"><i>They will live securely."Do not fear those who can kill the body, but fear Him who can cast both body and soul into hell." </i>Jesus brought a security that went beyond the physical. He has freed us from the second death and the slavery of sin in this life. His greatness has reached the ends of the earth. He is our peace with God. He has given us His own peace.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The religious leaders stayed with Herod while the wise men went to worship Jesus. Go to Him and lay your gifts at His feet. Find His peace, and let Him shepherd you.</p>
