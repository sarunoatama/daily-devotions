<p>Hebrews 12:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. <sup>2</sup>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. <sup>3</sup>Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The picture that the author is painting is of a great arena. The faithful who have died in Christ are occupying the stands. You and I are still here on the track running our race, staying in our lanes. The Greek runners ran in the nude so as not to be hindered by their clothing, but we seem to have all kinds of things on us. We carry some of the things of our past life, the life before we came to Christ. We need to drop it all and run!</p>
<p class="indent">Keep your eyes on our hero and role model, Jesus. Look at the amazing race He ran. If that doesn't inspire you to drop everything and run, nothing will. He fixed His eyes on the joy of seeing you transformed. With that vision He was able to finish His run on a shameful cross. That was the victory tape. When He burst through He found Himself the winner of all time, seated at the right hand of the throne of God. That is where we need to keep our eyes.</p>
<p class="indent">When the race gets tough, when you are tired and tempted to just give up, look at Jesus. What a race He ran! What a victory He won! He started you on this race, and He will help you finish it.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: If Jesus' life doesn't inspire you to run all out, what will?</p>
