<p class="indent">After Nathan delivered God's message to David, David was humbled. He asked God why He should be so good to him and honor his house so greatly. He ran out of words to say in the face of all the goodness of God. He declared that God knew him and yet He was pouring out all this goodness upon him. Then he makes the above statement. A God that could love me like this is a great God! He rules over all that is. There is none that even come close to comparing with Him. Who else could declare the future with such certainty? There really is no other god but the Sovereign LORD. We have heard the incomparable stories of what He has done. The incomparable God does incomparable acts.</p>
<p class="indent">You must realize that the promises to David are yours to claim. (Isaiah 55:3) He has been just as good in setting His everlasting love upon you. He has honored you beyond anything you could ever deserve, even though He knows you. He is making you a part of His eternal home. That is an honor that will take ages to absorb the greatness of.</p>
<p class="indent">What an awesome God who could love us so! Indeed, how great He is! He determines all things from the beginning. There is none like Him. There is no one who will be as good to you or love you so greatly or honor you so highly. It is all for the honor and glory of His name.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: We should be as humbled and awed as David was.</p>
