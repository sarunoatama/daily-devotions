<p>Psalms 28:7-9 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song. <sup>8</sup>The LORD is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one. <sup>9</sup>Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Most of us would not consider shepherding a training ground for a national leader. That was God's choice to train David. When the bear and lion came to tear the flock, David knew his strength was not sufficient. He learned to rely on the strength of the Lord. When his heart trusted in the LORD he found help and ended up writing a song of victory to the LORD.</p>
<p class="indent">He goes on to say the LORD is your strength, too. He knew it was true for everyone, for he was just a commoner when he began to find the strength that comes from God. His shepherd heart asked God to save the people and bless them. He knew he could do his best, but only God can save and bless. Then he asked for a very deeply symbolical request. <i>"Be their shepherd and carry them forever."</i></p>
<p class="indent">When a particular sheep would always wonder from the flock and get separated, it was in danger of being lost to predators. The shepherd had to exercise severe discipline to save the sheep's life. He would break the leg of the sheep and then reset it and carry that sheep until the leg healed. That sheep would grow so attached to the shepherd that it would never again stray. Sometimes the only way to save us is to take us through a difficulty that drives us to the LORD. As we cling to Him and He to us, we learn that is a wonderful place to be. When the difficulty passes, we find ourselves remaining there. Look at your painful experiences in the light of this picture and you will have a different perspective on it. Remember, the shepherd took on a burden for a period of time because he cared for the sheep.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember the expression, "This is going to hurt me a lot more than it does you?" It did. It does. Let that touch your heart today.</p>
