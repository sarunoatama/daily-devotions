<p>Matthew 13:28-30 (NIV) <i><sup>28</sup>"'An enemy did this,' he replied. "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' <sup>29</sup>"'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. <sup>30</sup>Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus shared a parable about a wheat field in which weeds were discovered. The owner of the field knew that an enemy had sown the weed seeds. Those who worked the field asked if they should pull the weeds up. The owner was concerned that the wheat would be too damaged in the process, so he told them to wait until the harvest. Then they would be able to separate the good from the bad.</p>
<p class="indent">This is one of the parables that Jesus later explained. We know exactly what He meant. The field is the world. The wheat are the children of God. The weeds are the children of the evil one. To pull out the wicked now would damage the wheat. We are to grow together until the harvest. The angels will separate the good from the bad. Jesus said that the angels will not only root out those who do evil, but everything that causes evil. That is a wonderful promise! The good will shine like the sun in the kingdom of the Father.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes we wonder why God does not strike the evil down now. He has given us the reason in this parable. Ancient farming was not done in rows. Walking into that field would cause some wheat to be damaged. Pulling up the roots of the weeds would damage roots of the wheat. God knows we need the testing and trials that the wicked bring our way. Those trials teach us patience, compassion, and most of all, cause us to trust in the sovereignty of God. Our natural mind thinks that we would do so much better if they were removed. Trust God to use those that trouble your life to draw you to Him. Know that they are not removed for a reason.</p>
