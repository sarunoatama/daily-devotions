<p>Proverbs 16:9 (NIV) <i><sup>9</sup>In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.</i></p>
<p>16:25 (NIV) <i><sup>25</sup>There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.</i></p>

<p class="indent">We often go through life guessing which way is best. A man who wants to please the LORD will ask for His direction and help in decisions. Sometimes the answer comes clearly, and at other times there seems to be no answer at all. Yet, because of our situation, we must make the choice we think is best. Scripture declares that the LORD has already planned our steps. He has ordained each day of our life to teach us and draw us closer. We often fret over our decisions, but what a peace to know that when we choose what we believe to be the LORD's will, we will either have His instruction that we have made a mistake or we will go on in the steps He has already ordered.</p>
<p class="indent">The other side of this coin is the second verse above, which is repeated in the proverbs. To merely go by what looks good or seems right, may end in disaster. Only God can see all the consequences from a decision. We need to take the time to seek God's direction. Just because it looks good to men, or even may be a success in the eyes of the world, doesn't mean it is good for you. So what are we to do?</p>
<p class="indent">Commit your way to the LORD. Seek to know His will. Get the counsel of godly people. Make your decision with a heart surrendered to God. Then, trust that if you have erred, the LORD will make it clear to you and show you how to correct your error. It is not as if God cannot get through to us. As long as we have a surrendered heart that is listening, He can make His will clear to us.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: If I am seeking to know God's will, He can make it known to me. Until He does, keep going in the direction He has led me.</p>
