<p>Luke 24:38-40 (NIV) <i><sup>38</sup>He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? <sup>39</sup>Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have." <sup>40</sup>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The disciples were still hiding for fear that they would be crucified next. Behind a locked door they wondered what to do. Had everything they hoped been completely dashed? And what was this strange report that the ladies brought back of an empty tomb. Then the two that were on the road to Emmaus declared they had seen and talked with Jesus. What could it all mean?</p>
<p class="indent">Suddenly Jesus stood among them! <i>"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?" </i>Why are we so reluctant to believe? After all they had witnessed, one would think this would not be so difficult to accept. His first sign to help them believe was to look at His hands and feet. They were the signs of what extent He would go for them, for us. He presented them first, displaying the fact that we are engraved upon His hands.</p>
<p class="indent">Then Jesus challenged them to touch Him to get rid of their doubts. He told them to see that He was flesh and bone. His blood had been poured out for them. He was not a spirit floating about; He was a transformed and resurrected man whose life source was no longer blood. Wouldn't it have been wonderful to watch the faces of the disciples as they turned from doubt and fear to utter wonder and worship?</p>
<p class="indent">To look at His hands and feet has the same affect on us. Every time we take communion we should look at His hands and feet and remember those wounds are still there because of His love for us. That gives us hope that our life source will no longer be blood. The life of flesh is in the blood, but one day our bodies will live by the Spirit.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Whatever you are going through this day, or at this point in your life, hear Jesus' ask you, <i>"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?" </i>Look at His hands and feet, and be at peace.</p>
