<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>February 4</h1>
<p>Exodus 12:22 (NIV) <i><sup>22</sup>Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Hebrew word for basin (<i>caph</i>) meant a drainage trough at the base of the door that kept rain from crossing the threshold and muddying the house. That is why it is sometimes translated threshold. Follow the Israelite head of his home as he takes a specific type of branch, hyssop, and from the base of the door marks the top and the sides. What has he just done? He has made a cross over the entrance of his dwelling.</p>
<p class="indent">Now come forward in time over a thousand years to a hill just outside a gate of Jerusalem. There is a man bleeding from his feet, his head, and his hands. Jesus is bleeding there for you so that the Destroyer cannot take your life. A Roman soldier grabs a branch with a sponge on the end to moisten Jesus' lips (John 19:29). What kind of branch is that? Hyssop!</p>
<p class="indent">Jump forward to today, two millenniums later. Night has come upon the earth for the world is in darkness, but in the house of the Lord there is light. Morning is coming. A new day will soon dawn, but until it does, you had better stay in the house (the fellowship of believers). The Destroyer is out in the streets and anyone not behind the cross of blood is fair game to him. <i>"In Him (Jesus) is life and the life is the light of men."</i></p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The message has remained the same for thousands of years. My soul is safe behind the cross of blood shed for me.</p>
