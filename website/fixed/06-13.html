<p>1 Kings 6:7 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Imagine the precision that had to be used to have the stones perfectly fit when they arrived at the temple site! Three-dimensional exactness had to be obtained at the quarry, for no pounding of any iron tool was to be heard at the site. Each block was custom made for an exact location to fit with the blocks beside and below.</p>
<p class="indent">Peter refers to believers as living stones. What kind of parallel can we see here? Jesus is the real builder of the temple of God, as the author of Hebrews declared. He must shape us to perfectly fit the place God has for us and that includes fitting in with those around us. Each of us has a calling and a place in the temple. But what does this noiseless activity represent?</p>
<p class="indent">The pounding and shaping, the noisy activity, should go on outside the temple site. When we gather to worship is not the time to hash out our differences. There we quietly behold His glory or sing His praises. There, our focus is not on our fit with the stone next to us but the wonder of our Savior. O come let us adore Him. Turn your eyes upon Jesus.</p>
<p class="indent">The hammering and shaping should go on in the quarry. One on one with the Lord, we should allow ourselves to be shaped. The places in our life that do not fit with the other living stones must be chiseled away. That noisy and often painful activity goes on in the quarry with Jesus so that we do not disturb the focus of others as we gather to worship corporately. Are you letting Him remove from you the protrusions in your life that keep you from fitting perfectly with the rest of the building?</p>
<p class="comment">Take time alone with God to let Him make some reductions in you so that you fit with the other stones.</p>
