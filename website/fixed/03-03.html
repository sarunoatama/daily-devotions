<p>Numbers 11:14, 16-17 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me...</i></p>
<p><i><sup>16</sup>The LORD said to Moses: "Bring me seventy of Israel's elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you. <sup>17</sup>I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone.</i></p>

<p class="indent">There is only one man that is meant to be the leader that all look to, Jesus of Nazareth. God brought Moses to the place where he recognized that carrying the burden of all the people was not meant for an under-shepherd. Jesus is the Great Shepherd, and He employs many under-shepherds. Even when we cast it upon the Lord, it can just get to be too much for us to deal with. We were meant to share the load with our brothers and sisters in the faith. As we gather with them, God places His Spirit upon them (now within them) so they can be His instruments. They help God ordained leadership carry the burden of the people.</p>
<p class="indent">When we try to carry it alone, we find ourselves facing depression as was Moses. He asked the Lord to put him to death. All the complaining just became overwhelming. But when we stand together with a team filled with the Spirit, we share the load and build one another up. Each finds his place of ministry and we work together as God intended.</p>
<p class="indent">Jethro had given Moses this advice earlier, but what was lacking? The elders needed the Spirit to truly be able to carry Moses' burden for the people. A worker can do physical activities and make decisions, but a Spirit filled worker helps to carry the burden for the people.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Do I rely on the Spirit to help me carry the load in the fellowship I attend?</p>
