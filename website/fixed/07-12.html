<p>2 Kings 19:1-2 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD. <sup>2</sup>He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Assyrian captain came to Jerusalem and shouted to all the people his line of propaganda. Basically, he said that the gods of other nations had not been able to deliver them and neither would Jehovah deliver Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="indent">When the officials brought the news to Hezekiah, he tore his clothes (a sign of anguish). He put on sackcloth (the rough garment was a sign of self- humiliation). Then he went to the temple of the LORD. In our last devotional we read that Hezekiah was a man who trusted in the LORD. When trouble comes you will turn to the place you really trust, regardless of what you profess.</p>
<p class="indent">Though Hezekiah was a righteous king, the LORD had allowed the defeat of many of the fortified cities of Judah. Just because you follow God with all your heart does not mean there will not be defeats and hardship. But we know where to turn. He went to the temple to seek God.</p>
<p class="indent">He also sent his whole staff in sackcloth to the prophet Isaiah. The prophet of the Old Testament was the spokesman for God. Hezekiah knew he needed to hear from God. The outcome of his godly response was an angel of God slaying 185,000 of the enemy and sending the remainder back to Assyria where their general was murdered. Archeologists have found evidence that verifies that Jerusalem was the one city that Assyria did not conquer at that time. God is faithful to those who place their trust in Him.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Trouble may come our way. We may suffer defeats. But if we humble ourselves and place our hope in God, we will ultimately prevail in spite of the odds.</p>
