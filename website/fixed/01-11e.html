<p>Habakkuk 1:13 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?</i></p>
<p>2:3-4 (NIV) <i><sup>3</sup>For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay. <sup>4</sup>"See, he is puffed up; his desires are not upright&#8211; but the righteous will live by his faith...</i></p>

<p class="indent">The prophet Habakkuk listed his complaints before God. He argued from his knowledge of the glorious attributes of God. It is not as though we are convincing God to be of the character we know Him to be; we are assuring ourselves. We are encouraging our faith when we recall who He is.</p>
<p class="indent">In this passage, Habakkuk reminds himself of God's holiness. If evil men are devouring those more righteous than themselves, surely God will bring judgment in His perfect time. We may know what God will do, and yet not know the time in which He deems best to act. He may show us clearly in a revelation or in His Word what will come, yet we do not know the day or hour. Many prophets died before their prophecies were fulfilled. God has an appointed time for all things. His timing is unquestionably perfect.</p>
<p class="indent">Habakkuk knew God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. He also knew that what is required of the righteous is to live by their faith. That means to go on believing in the character of God regardless of the present conditions or circumstances. This verse is quoted three times in the New Testament. (Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38) Live by your faith!</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Know that God is unchanging and will always be true to His perfect attributes. He will show Himself just, holy, and faithful in His perfect time.</p>
