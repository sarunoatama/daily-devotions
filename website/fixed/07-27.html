<p>1 Chronicles 21:22-24 (NIV) <i><sup>22</sup>David said to him, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price." <sup>23</sup>Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this." <sup>24</sup>But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Because of David's sin in numbering the people, he had chosen between three possible curses. He chose three days of plague. When the angel stood over Jerusalem with his sword drawn, David knew he must act. 70,000 had already died. He interceded for the people and asked that the curse fall on him and his family since he had committed the sin. The LORD told David, through the prophet Gad, to build an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="indent">This was the same place that Abraham had offered Isaac. It is the same ridge upon which the Lamb of God would be offered for the sins of the world. It is where the chaff is blown away, and what is of value remains. For Abraham, the hope in his son was "blown away" and trust in God remained. For Jesus, the sins of the world were blown away with his blood, and redeemed children of God remained. For David, the guilt was about to be blown away, and a forgiven man would remain.</p>
<p class="indent">David wanted to purchase the ground upon which to build the altar and later the Temple. Araunah offered to give it to him. You might say he was generous, but remember that he is standing in the shadow of an angel with a sword. David insisted on paying full price. Though Jesus paid our sin debt, it was not as if it was inexpensive. He paid the full price in our place. Offerings cost. It cost God the greatest price that could be paid. When we give to God our own hearts, we too, should be willing to pay with lives of service.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Will you sacrifice to God what costs you nothing or will you give Him your all?</p>
