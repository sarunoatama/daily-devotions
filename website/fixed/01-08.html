<p>Genesis 3:15 (NIV) <i><sup>15</sup>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">This is the first declaration in Scripture that God would deal with sin, and it is made to Satan in the earshot of Adam and Eve. It is in the same chapter as the fall of man. As God is pronouncing the affects of sin upon their lives and the world in which they live, He also gives man a promise and Satan a warning. First there is the declaration that there will be hatred between Satan and man. The seed, or offspring, of the woman will be in conflict with the offspring of Satan. Satan is out to kill, steal, and destroy. (John 10:10) But there is one Seed (singular) that will specifically take on Satan and crush his head (authority and rule). This promise tells us that the Victor will be a male descendent of Eve.</p>
<p class="indent">God was quick to give mankind a hope to look forward to by faith. People living before Christ looked forward to the Victor of the enemy of their souls, by faith, just as we look back with faith. We all trust that the crushing of Satan's head was sufficient to rescue us from Satan's authority, the authority over us that our sin gave him. In the process the Savior's heel was struck. Archeologists have discovered that crucified victims were nailed through the heel bone. Jesus' heels were pierced like the two teeth fangs of the serpent, one through each heel. In the process, Satan's head was crushed. Satan tried to bite our Savior, but the bite resulted in his defeat and our salvation. The promise has been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are you living free from the authority of that defeated one and in the power of the risen Victor?</p>
