<p>1 Kings 17:2-4 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah: <sup>3</sup>"Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan. <sup>4</sup>You will drink from the brook, and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Elijah had just predicted that until he prayed for rain there would be no rain on the land. Then God sent Elijah to a hide from the king and provided for him in a rather unusual way. The ravens brought him the ingredients for sandwiches. If you've ever watched ravens eat, you know they do not like to share. That's quite a miracle. God is Lord over His creation.</p>
<p class="indent">I once read a story of a Chinese brother who was imprisoned for his faith. The guards withheld his food because he would not renounce Christ, so the LORD ordered mice to bring him food. He probably ate better on what the mice brought than if the prison had served him his meals.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus told us not to worry about what we will eat or wear because we have a Father in heaven that knows we are in need. If He feeds the sparrows he will feed us, for He values us more than the sparrows. The psalmist said, from his youth to his old age, he had never seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.</p>
<p class="indent">If we are obedient to the LORD, we will not starve. We may not always have the abundance we might prefer, but God will care for us. Having food and clothing, we should be content. If we can learn to be content with the few necessities of life, the many things that distract us will lose their power of influence over us. We can then give our attention to the LORD and His instruction to us. He didn't promise us luxury in this life, in fact, he promised tribulation. But we have the assurance that He will care for us as a Father cares for his children.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: Rest assured, the LORD will care for you.</p>
