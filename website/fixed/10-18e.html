<p>Colossians 2:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him, <sup>7</sup>rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. <sup>8</sup>See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The mystery that had been a secret for thousands of years was finally revealed. The Christ was to come as a man in Whom dwelt all the fullness of God, and yet die for our sins as our sacrificial lamb. Now that they knew the secret of the ages, having received Jesus as Lord, Paul encouraged them to continue to live in Him. Moment by moment we must decide whether or not we will abide in Him or return to reigning over our own lives. It helps us to make the right choice when we realize the goodness of God in bringing this mystery to light.</p>
<p class="indent">More then merely living in Him, we need to sink down roots and grow strong in this new life. We know that the winds of adversity and temptation will come, so we should prepare for it. Go further today than you were yesterday in surrender, submission and love. Grow stronger in your faith by exercising the faith you have been given. Learn more of the wonderful truths of Christ from His word. Express your gratitude for all He has done for you frequently and at every opportunity.</p>
<p class="indent">There will always be false teachers that try to lure you back into letting the flesh reign. Their teaching can be cunningly clever, but you can recognize it by its similarity with human traditions and worldly principles. It certainly won't be based on Christ, God's answer to the need of man. Paul said this type of teaching takes you captive. If, like the Israelites, you wish to return to the old, someone will present you with a plan that can justify doing so. The only way to prepare yourself against such deception is to grow deeper in dependency on Christ. Live in Him. Sink down roots. Grow up strong in your faith.</p>
<p class="comment">Love Him more today than you did yesterday.</p>
