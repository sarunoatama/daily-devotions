<p>Mark 13:35-37 (NIV) <i><sup>35</sup>"Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back&#8211;whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn. <sup>36</sup>If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping. <sup>37</sup>What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!'"</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus likened His return to a master who went on a journey. He asked the keeper of the door to stand watch. To watch meant to be vigilant. It meant to actively be attentive. Though the master of the household is away, the servants are supposed to go about their business and not take advantage of His absence. We do not have the manifest presence of Christ here before us reminding us that He is Lord. The gentle Holy Spirit within our hearts is easily quieted by our stubborn willfulness. These words of Christ came at the end of His discourse on the destruction of the Temple and His Second Coming. In the millenniums in between, many Christians have heard this warning to remain at their post.</p>
<p class="indent">The world would lull us to sleep with ease and comfort, but we must remember we don't know the number of our days. No one is guaranteed 80 years. Accidents and disease strike without warning. You could enter into His presence today. Will He find you were vigilant to the end? Will He find your first love was still burning strong? Death may find you in your youth, in middle age or in your twilight years. Remain vigilant to the end. Jesus may return when you are not expecting. What will He find you doing? At 12 years of age He said He had to be about His Father's business. At 30 years of age He said He had done the work the Father had given Him to do. Jesus is our ultimate example of remaining actively attentive to the will of the Father throughout His life.</p>
<p class="indent">Those servants who are found to be faithful at His return will be rewarded. Those who are asleep, lulled by the world into inactivity, will be dealt with. Are you watching?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Will this day find you actively attentive to the work the Master has given you to do? Endure! Watch! We must be about our Father's business.</p>
