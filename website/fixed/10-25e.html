<p>2 Thessalonians 2:9-11 (NIV) <i><sup>9</sup>The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders, <sup>10</sup>and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. <sup>11</sup>For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie...</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Thessalonians were concerned that perhaps they had missed the Second Coming of Christ. Paul told them that there would be a falling away first and that the man of sin would be revealed. Then he went on to tell them what that would be like. He called him the lawless one and said that Satan would work to produce counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders. He will work in such a way as to give those who refuse the truth something to believe in. This method has always been at work, but it will reach a crescendo before Christ's return.</p>
<p class="indent">If people refuse the truth, God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie. To believe in and love the truth and become a son or daughter of God is a wonderful privilege. Those who refuse to do so, those who reject the gift of salvation, will be given something they can believe in.</p>
<p class="indent">It happens today in a less obvious way. There are many false religions that allow you to remain on the throne of your life and yet give you a false sense of spiritual growth. These religions are based on pride and selfishness. Man desires to cling to these two vices more than any other. Satan has custom designed lies that feed these desires. Those who refuse to love the truth readily accept them.</p>
<p class="indent">It can also happen in small ways in the believer's life. When the Spirit points out an area we have not given over to the lordship of Christ, we can make excuses and even come up with reasons why it is alright to stay in control. God allows this for a time, but in every believer He will continue to confront it until we face the truth.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Those who refused to love the truth will accept deception. Those who love the truth will be shown the areas in their thought life that are still in error.</p>
