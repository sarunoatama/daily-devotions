<p>1 Samuel 17:45,46b,47 (NIV) <i><sup>45</sup>David said to the Philistine, "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied</i></p>
<p><i>. <sup>46b</sup>...the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. <sup>47</sup>All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give all of you into our hands."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Goliath hurried to meet David. When he saw he was just a boy, he mocked him and made boasting threats. David responded with the facts. Goliath had physical weapons upon which he relied. David declared that he fought as a representative of LORD of the armies of heaven and the armies of Israel. "The outcome of the battle," he declared, "will show that there is a God in Israel." David fought that the world might know God.</p>
<p class="indent">He declared one more reason that God would bring the victory, that everyone gathered would know that the LORD does not save by sword or spear. He is the One who determines the outcome of battle. It is His battle. "He is about to give you, Goliath, into my hands," David was saying.</p>
<p class="indent">What faith David had in his God! He was so certain that he ran to meet Goliath. For David it was a chance to proclaim the greatness of his God. Saul needed to be reminded the battle was not about physical weapons. The fearful army of Israel needed that reminder. We do too. Though it is not a physical war we fight, we often try to solve our spiritual wars through natural solutions like man made reasoning, instead of prayer and faith. Are you declaring that the outcome of your battle will show God is alive and well? Do you know it is not up to man to win it, for it is the Lord's battle?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are you fighting for self or God's testimony?</p>
