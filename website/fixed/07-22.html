<p>1 Chronicles 16:8-11 (NIV) <i><sup>8</sup>Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done. <sup>9</sup>Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts. <sup>10</sup>Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. <sup>11</sup>Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Chronicles records the story of the ark coming to Jerusalem. The first time they tried to bring it their own way, and Uzzah died. The second time they did it according to the word of the LORD. There was great rejoicing. David danced so all-out that his wife despised him. Musicians were appointed to play before the ark on a regular basis. David gave gifts of food to everyone. It was truly a festive occasion.</p>
<p class="indent">At that time, David committed a psalm to his worship leader, Asaph. He didn't just give it to him, but committed it to him. Asaph had this Spirit inspired song and was now responsible to see it sung. Is that how we feel about Spirit inspired music? It is committed to our worship leaders so that they see it is sung to the LORD.</p>
<p class="indent">In this psalm, David commands us to give thanks to the LORD, to call on His name and to tell the nations what God has done. He is commanding us to send out missionaries. We are to sing to Him! We often sing about Him, telling of His wonderful acts, but we need to sing to Him also. We are to glory in His holy name. His name is the sum of His attributes. Glory in all that God is! If you seek the LORD, your heart should rejoice.</p>
<p class="indent">Then David shared a lesson that was just reinforced. He sought God when the Philistine army came against Israel. The first time God directed them one way to victory. The second time God directed them in a different way, and they defeated the enemy again. Look to the LORD and His strength; seek His face always. That is something Saul did not do, but David was determined to do.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are you as determined as David to rely on God's strength and to seek His face always?</p>
