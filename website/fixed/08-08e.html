<p>Romans 4:19-21 (NIV) <i><sup>19</sup>Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead&#8211;since he was about a hundred years old&#8211;and that Sarah's womb was also dead. <sup>20</sup>Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, <sup>21</sup>being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Apostle Paul makes the case that Abraham is the father of all believers, both Jew and Gentile. Since he trusted in the promise of God and was counted as righteous before he received the covenant of circumcision, he is father of those who have not entered into Jewish ritual but still trust in God. His example clearly shows us that it is not by works that we are made right with God, but by believing and trusting in God.</p>
<p class="indent">His faith is an example to us all. Even when his body and that of his wife's were incapable of producing a child, he believed God's promise that they would have a boy. If God told you that a 100-year-old man and a 90-year-old woman would have a child, would you believe it? Faith believes what cannot be seen or reasoned with the natural mind. Faith pleases God.</p>
<p class="indent">What has God promised to you? He has promised all believers that He will transform them into the likeness of His Son. You may look at your thoughts and actions today and think it is impossible, but God has promised. Won't you be like Abraham who looked beyond the natural and was fully persuaded that God had the power to do what He promised? Once you are fully persuaded, begin to act by faith on the promise.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Live in the confidence that what He has begun, He will bring to completion. It will keep you from wallowing in your failures.</p>
