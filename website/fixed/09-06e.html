<p>2 Corinthians 2:14-16 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him. <sup>15</sup>For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. <sup>16</sup>To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?</i></p>

<p class="indent">When the Roman army conquered a region, the commander would return to Rome for a triumphal procession. The captives and their treasures would be paraded down the main street of Rome so that all could see. Paul says we are always being led like captives. There is a great difference. Those led by the Roman army were sadly going into servitude or death. We are going joyfully into servitude and death.</p>
<p class="indent">Our Captor is none other than the King of kings. His intentions are for our good. The king we once served under was brutal. In some cases, it was the same with Rome. The people saw captivity to Rome as a better situation than the regime they lived under. Our situation is infinitely better. We go with great joy because we know the good intentions of the heart of our Captor. We call Him our Liberator, our Redeemer.</p>
<p class="indent">As we are led, we spread the fragrance of the knowledge of Him. Sometimes those watching the procession do not know of His great heart and fear being taken captive. They catch that scent of the knowledge of Him, but it smells like death to them. Others catch the fragrance and smell life. The perishing smell death. Those that are being saved smell life. Are you spreading the fragrance?</p>
<p class="indent">What a task we have! Sometimes we look like we are going into hard servitude. We certainly shouldn't. His yoke is easy and His burden is light. Does the audience smell His fragrance as you pass? Do they see the joy of serving Christ, or a whining servant that is thinking of returning to Egypt?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Only Christ can make us equal to the task of spreading His delightful fragrance.</p>
