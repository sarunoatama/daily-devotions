<p>Psalms 45:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. <sup>7</sup>You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy. <sup>8</sup>All your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces adorned with ivory the music of the strings makes you glad.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This psalm is by the sons of Korah. Korah had challenged the decision to have Aaron and sons be the priests. The earth opened up and swallowed him. His descendants, however, were still given the privilege to be musicians for the house of God. Many of the psalms were written by them. What an expression of the mercy of God! This psalm was a wedding song, possibly for Solomon. Just as in the Song of Songs, the theme moves from Solomon and his wife to Jesus and the church. Since Jesus is of the lineage of David, He is often referred to as The Son of David, and Solomon is in some respect a shadow of The Son of David who was to come.</p>
<p class="indent">We especially see the overlap in verse 6. It is God that is being addressed. His Kingdom is the one just Kingdom. He is the One who truly loves righteousness and hates wickedness. God anointed Christ Jesus with the oil of joy (Hebrews 1:8-9). The Biblical picture of Jesus is of One who is more joyful than all His disciples. Joy is a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22). As you grow in Christ's likeness, you will find an increasing measure of joy.</p>
<p class="indent">His robes are fragrant. As we carry His life into the world, people get a whiff of the fragrance of the Lord (2 Corinthians 2:14). The music of strings makes Him glad. The abundance of worship music today is bringing gladness to the heart of Jesus. Don't you love that thought? I hope this prophetic picture of Christ has changed your impression of the One we serve. He does weep for the lost. He does grieve with you in your trials and feels your pain. Yet, He knows the future, and He is the most joyful One you will ever meet.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The psalm goes on to speak of the bride. That is you and me! This is our wedding song! Savor it!</p>
