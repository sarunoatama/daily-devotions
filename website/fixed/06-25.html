<p>1 Kings 19:7-8 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, "Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you." <sup>8</sup>So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Poor Elijah! He had been on the run and in hiding for three and a half years. He brought a great victory for God and was forced back into hiding again. God sent an angel to deliver the food and water he needed. Elijah was so tired from the spiritual conflict that he needed an angelic alarm clock. He was encouraged to eat to get the strength he needed for the journey.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a temptation for those suffering from depression to forget the physical. Elijah needed to eat to get the strength to move to a new setting. We can use a change of scenery. It gets our mind off the problems that have overwhelmed us. Then we are able to hear from God without the cloud of things troubling us and distorting what He speaks to our hearts.</p>
<p class="indent">He traveled to the same place Moses got his inspiration, Horeb. Horeb means 'fresh inspiration'. That was what Moses needed too. Moses went from second in Egypt to being a shepherd and had given up the hope of helping his people. When we get to the place of despair that Elijah and Moses were in, we need to get away to a mountain of inspiration. We need to meet with God and hear from Him. We need God's perspective on our situation. (To be continued.)</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Where do you need to go for some fresh inspiration?</p>
