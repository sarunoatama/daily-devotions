<p>Galatians 3:26-29 (NIV) <i><sup>26</sup>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, <sup>27</sup>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. <sup>28</sup>There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup>29</sup>If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</i></p>

<p class="indent">What makes a person a child of God? Paul clearly says that it is through faith in Christ Jesus. Immersed (baptized) in Christ, we become clothed in Christ. When the world sees us, it should see Christ. This transformation does not come about by trying to be good. Certainly we need to cooperate with the Spirit, and that is sometimes a battle between our flesh and spirit. If we are in Christ, the spirit in us, where Christ is enthroned, should rule our flesh. When that is the case, the world sees Jesus in our words and actions.</p>
<p class="indent">It doesn't matter what our gender, nationality, or status in life are. We express the life of Christ. That is the only way the early church was so successful at converting the world and standing against persecution. They were indwelt by Christ, and they were clothed in Christ. That is what made them one. That is what makes us one. The same nature, character and expression of that character show a unity. That is what makes the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit One.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as you look back to the work of Christ, the patriarchs looked forward to the work that God promised them. As Abraham placed his faith in God's ability to provide a son, and the Son, God counted his faith as righteousness. God made specific promises about a descendant. You and I become recipients of the promises when we place our faith in Christ. Being in Christ makes you the seed of Abraham. It makes you an heir of the promise.</p>
<p class="indent">God didn't have a plan that didn't work and then have to improvise. He has known from the beginning exactly what He would do to bring mankind to Himself. Don't neglect the Old Testament. In it we find shadows, pictures, and promises that reveal the nature of God and His plan for us.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: As you get dressed each morning, clothe yourself with Christ.</p>
