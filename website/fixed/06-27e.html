<p>John 14:5-7 (NIV) <i><sup>5</sup>Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" <sup>6</sup>Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. <sup>7</sup>If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Jesus told His disciples of His imminent departure and that they would know the way to Him. Thomas asked how they could possibly know the way when they didn't even know where He was going. Jesus had just said He was going to the Father. How many times does the Lord speak something to us, yet we don't comprehend it?</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus answered with a triple "I AM" statement. <i>"I am the way and the truth and the life."</i> Jesus is the way to the Father. The way is not mapped out, nor is it a series of do's and don'ts. The way is a Person. Unless you go through this Person, Jesus, you can never come to the Father. Anyone that ever lived that came to the Father came through Jesus, whether they knew His name or not. From Abraham to doubting Thomas to Billy Graham, each had only one way to access the Father, through Jesus Christ. It is the same for us.</p>
<p class="indent">He is truth. His life and words are truth, yes, but truth is a person. The word of truth became flesh. You cannot possess real truth without Jesus. He is life. Without Him there is no life. Those who would downplay Jesus' role and importance must disregard this verse as the words of an egomaniac. Either He is God or one of the most demented men to ever live.</p>
<p class="indent">Then Jesus makes it very plain. If you want to get to God, realize that knowing me is knowing God. If you've seen me then you have seen God. This was an explanation of Himself as the way. Jesus is the visible manifestation of the invisible God. Seeing Him is the only way to see God.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Is He the way and the truth and the life to you?</p>
