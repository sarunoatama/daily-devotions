<p>Matthew 8:25-27 (NIV) <i><sup>25</sup>The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!" <sup>26</sup>He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. <sup>27</sup>The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!"</i></p>

<p class="indent">In a recent low water level of the Kinneseret Lake, a boat dating back to the first century was found preserved in the mud. Archeologists know it was a Jewish boat from that time because there are murals remaining to this day of those boats. If this is the same kind that Jesus and His disciples were in, twelve people would have made a very full boat. There was a quarterdeck up front, under which the nets could be stored. Jesus was probably under there sleeping on the nets. He was an early riser. Before the day got going, He got His instructions and fellowship with His Father. He must have been wiped out physically to have slept through the storm. Jesus was an all out kind of person.</p>
<p class="indent">This seems like another one of Satan's attempts to stop Jesus. Other Gospels tell us that He was on His way to the Gentile region of Decapolis. The Gospel was going to make great advances there. We can expect resistance when we are obeying the will of the Father. The Jews considered the depths of that lake to be the Abyss. To think they might drown was more than just a fear of death. They woke Jesus and pleaded for Him to save them.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus first rebuked them for their lack of faith. The rebuke was not that they did not do what He was about to do, but that they feared. Faith believes that God is greater than any difficulty or situation we find ourselves in. Jesus' chosen ones need never fear. Their Shepherd is greater than all. Then he rebuked the wind and waves, and there was a complete calm. <i>What kind of man is this? </i>What is your answer? It has a great deal to do with whether you will have fear or faith. If your answer is, "He is my Savior, Creator, Master, and friend!", then you need never fear what comes your way.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Go ahead, ask yourself what kind of man creation obeys.</p>
