<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>December 8</h1>
<p>1 Peter 5:7-9 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. <sup>8</sup>Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. <sup>9</sup>Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.</i></p>

<p class="indent">If you have worries and concerns that are weighing you down, you need to find someone who can help you carry them or assure you that they can help you get through them. But who doesn't have enough worries of their own? And who cares enough to share those burdens? And who has the power to assist you through the circumstances of life? Jesus! He cares! And He invites you to cast your cares on Him. He can either change the situation, or give you the grace to get through it by carrying your load.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the struggles we face are the attacks of Satan in our life. He is looking for sheep that have strayed away from the Shepherd. Like a lion, he lurks in the shadows waiting for the lamb that might wander off looking for some kind of curiosity. He doesn't dare go near the sheep that are close to the Shepherd, for the Shepherd has a big rod.</p>
<p class="indent">What should you do when in following that nice swath of grass you are drawn into your enemy's reach? Resist him! Bleat! Call out to the Shepherd, while standing firm in your faith. Expect the Shepherd to come bounding toward the enemy with giant leaping strides. Know in your heart that lambs around the world are undergoing the same kind of attacks. The Shepherd has the amazing ability to be there for each one of them. We may suffer some injury because we have strayed so far, or because of the enemy's subtleties. We can rest assured that the Shepherd will bind our wounds and carry us until we have recovered.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: What concerns are on my heart today that I need to cast upon my Lord? I must keep from reeling them back.</p>
