<p>Colossians 1:27-29 (NIV) <i><sup>27</sup>To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. <sup>28</sup>We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. <sup>29</sup>To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The prophets gave clues. Their words spoke of time when God would dwell among His people. They wrote of a transformed life. They told of a day when the Spirit of God would be poured out. Jesus clarified those ancient prophecies by saying that He would be back to make His home in those who obeyed Him. The apostles came to realize they were living in that day.</p>
<p class="indent">They came to realize the presence of Christ in them was what gave them the power and righteousness to live a life that glorified God. His presence in them was also their hope of glory in heaven. In the past, they had wondered about whether or not they had kept the laws, if they were good enough, if their sacrifices were sufficient, but now they had the assurance of heaven through the presence of Christ in their hearts.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the sum of Paul's teaching and doctrine; to know Christ. If you are found in Christ, and He in you, you will be found perfect before God. Paul wanted to see as many as possible know the life transforming presence of Jesus Christ in their hearts. He was the power that motivated and led Paul to reach out to more and more. Christ's love for those for whom He died drove Paul onward.</p>
<p class="indent">Is the hope of glory living in you? Do you have that assurance of heaven because of His presence? If so, in what way is His energy at work in you to reach out to others that they might be found perfect in Christ? If not, realize what He has done for you and His plan for your life. Give up your ways and accept Him as your Master today. The wondering will be replaced by His glorious presence in your heart. His energy in you will help you fulfill the purpose for which you were created.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: His energy can work powerfully in you too.</p>
