<p>Deuteronomy 11:26-28 (NIV) <i><sup>26</sup>See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse&#8211; <sup>27</sup>the blessing if you obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today; <sup>28</sup>the curse if you disobey the commands of the LORD your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Recently, the Prayer of Jabez has become quite popular. It is a wonderful prayer that asks for the Lord to change the circumstances in which we find ourselves into blessings. We do need to remember that blessings are contingent upon obedience. As New Testament saints, we emphasize grace, but that does not change the principle of these verses. We still reap what we sow. We cannot ask for blessing while walking in disobedience and expect God to wink at our disobedience.</p>
<p class="indent">The choice to obey is clearly laid before us. Instead of the many rules of the Old Testament Law, we have the leading of the Holy Spirit that indwells us. We choose to obey or disobey. We choose curse or blessing. It is sad that we think we can pray for God to remove this just principle. It is there to deter us from evil and guide us into life.</p>
<p class="indent">What are these other gods? They are ones that promise prosperity in spite of disobedience. They are lies that say that the pleasure of sin is more than momentary. They offer an alternative to the cut and dried choice of obedience and blessing or disobedience and curse. They lie! They are disobedience and curse in disguise.</p>
