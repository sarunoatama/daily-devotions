<p>2 Samuel 9:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor. David said, "Mephibosheth!" "Your servant," he replied. <sup>7</sup>"Don't be afraid," David said to him, "for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table." <sup>8</sup>Mephibosheth bowed down and said, "What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?"</i></p>

<p class="indent">David remembered his covenant with Jonathan. Though he was in a position of power and needed to answer to none, he knew he must answer to God. David asked a former servant of Saul if there were any of Saul's family left. Only Mephibpsheth the son of Jonathan survived. He was crippled in both feet. Mephibosheth came fearing for his life, but David only wanted to bless him. He restored all the land that belonged to Saul and appointed the servant of Saul and the servant's family to care for him. He also gave him a place at his table. That meant he would always eat the best and have fellowship with the King's family. Mephibosheth was shocked. <i>Who am I that you would notice a dead dog like me?</i></p>
<p class="indent">We are a lot like Mephibosheth. We are really powerless to do much. We are lame in our own way. Our family (mankind) sought the King's life. Though Jesus is anointed King, like David, we served another. Our family lost the conflict, but He still loves us and keeps His covenant toward us. He only seeks to do us good. He calls us to come before Him, and we tremble as if He would destroy us. He says, "Fear not. I will surely show you kindness for the sake of Christ Jesus. From now on, eat at my table.</p>
<p class="comment">Admonition: Have fellowship with the King's family and eat the Word provided for you.</p>
