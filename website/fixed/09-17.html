<p>Job 9:2-4 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God? <sup>3</sup>Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand. <sup>4</sup>His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?</i></p>

<p class="indent">Job's friends came to comfort him, and sat silent for seven days. What can you say to a friend who has endured such loss? Finally Job spoke of his misery. He wished he had been stillborn. He considered his pain greater than the joys he experienced in life. Good people may experience situations in which they despair of life itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Then his friends made an all too common mistake. They tried to counsel him in his grief. One insisted that he must have sinned. Job replied that he was not aware of any specific sin, and if he did not intend to sin, wouldn't God find mercy to forgive. The other friend insisted no one is perfect before God. Our verse today is Job's reply. Of course we are not perfect in his sight. How can anyone be righteous before God? If we were to have a debate with God, we couldn't really respond to any of God's questions. No one can stand before the Almighty and say He has not been righteous in all His acts.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, Job did not understand what he was going through. Why should all this trouble be allowed to strike him? He could not see the heavenly conflict or understand how good would come from such suffering. It will be another 30 chapters before his eyes are opened and he submits quietly to the sovereignty of God. What can we learn from this passage today? Sometimes the best thing is to say nothing, but weep with those that weep. There will be times in our lives that we have no explanation for suffering. Endure, and believe that God is working all things out for the good of those that love Him and are called according to His purpose. There are times when we are teaching angelic beings about love for God and trust in His character and sovereignty. Satan refused to believe Job could continue to have faith in God, but Job proved him wrong. Though he voiced the fact that he did not understand what God was doing, he never doubted the integrity of God.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: You don't have to understand what is happening, but you do need keep trusting God.</p>
