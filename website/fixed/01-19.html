<p>Genesis 19:12-14 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>The two men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here&#8211;sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, <sup>13</sup>because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it." <sup>14</sup>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, "Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Angels had come to deliver Lot from the city of Sodom before it was destroyed. The angels were willing to deliver all those related to Lot. I wonder if the outcry to the LORD against its people was from the citizens of Sodom. Man is so obtuse that he can complain to God about the consequences of his own actions and those of others doing the same things. Sin has a way of torturing those it has mastered. The people refused to be freed from the sin by forsaking it. To stop the misery that sin caused, the people had to have their lives cut short.</p>
<p class="indent">Lot warned his sons-in-law of the impending doom, but they seemed to think he was joking. Why wouldn't they take him seriously? Was it because Lot's life was so compromised that they couldn't imagine he would be the special recipient of an angelic mercy mission? After all, he sat in the gate as an official of Sodom, and he probably joked around with the best of them. He probably fit right in since he had become a judge. I believe his compromised life caused his message to sound like a joke.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a no less serious judgment coming on all the earth (2 Peter 3:7). We have been given a message and a chance to go out and warn others too. When they see our lives, do they consider our message a joke? Or do our lives add credence to our message? The way we live will add power to, or detract from, the message. Let us live in such a way as to add conviction to the words we speak so that others may be spared from the impending wrath of God.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Does my life backup the message?</p>
