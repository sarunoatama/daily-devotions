<p>2 Kings 5:10-12 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, "Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed." <sup>11</sup>But Naaman went away angry and said, "I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy. <sup>12</sup>Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than any of the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them and be cleansed?" So he turned and went off in a rage.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Naaman was a great commander in the army of the king of Aram. He had contracted some type of skin disease. His wife's servant was a young girl from Israel. The young girl spoke of a prophet that could cure Naaman. With the king's permission, he journeyed to Israel to be cured. The king of Israel thought it was a ploy to have reason for the king of Aram to go to war with Israel. Elisha sent word that the king of Israel need not worry. He asked that Naaman be sent to him so that Naaman would know there was a prophet in Israel. Actually, God was after Naaman. He was pursuing him by means of his affliction. If Naaman believed Jehovah's prophet could cure, then he would believe in Jehovah.</p>
<p class="indent">Naaman had other issues to be dealt with, namely his pride. Instead of going out to meet this esteemed commander, Elisha just sent a messenger. God's direction for healing was a humbling thing. The Jordan is dirty and mucky. Pride sent Naaman into a rage at this simple request, but his servants calmed him down and helped him to humble himself. After the seventh dip, Naaman came up with skin like a young boy's. He had a conversion experience. His outward cleansing caused him to trust in God for an inward cleansing. He took soil back from Israel so that he could worship the God that he now knew to be the one true God.</p>
<p class="indent">The biggest miracle was not that his skin was cleansed but that his heart was changed. God pursues everyone with the desire to see them know Him. Will we humble ourselves and let Him do a miracle in our lives, or demand that He meet our expectations?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Humble yourself in the sight of the LORD and He will lift you up.</p>
