<p>1 Kings 19:13b,14,18 (NIV) <i><sup>13b</sup>Then a voice said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" <sup>14</sup>He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too."</i></p>
<p><i><sup>18</sup>"Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel&#8211;all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him."</i></p>

<p class="indent">God asked Elijah what he was doing on Horeb. Of course, God knew the answer, but Elijah needed to express it. I think this is a common tool that God uses to make us aware of our sense of reality. So what is your doing, reader? Take a moment to think how you would respond to your Maker if He were to ask you that right now.</p>
<p class="indent">Elijah told God how zealous he had been for God and how alone he felt because of it. He told how he was fleeing again for his life. God had news for Elijah. He told him to anoint the coming kings and his own successor. That was a vision for the near future and motivation to get back to work. Then God had a correction to make to Elijah's pity party. He was not alone. There were 7000 people who had not worshipped Baal.</p>
<p class="indent">At times we get discouraged and think we are the only ones that are serious about God. Individuals and churches can feel that way, but there are always others that love God. He always keeps a remnant for Himself. They may not look and act like you do, but God has kept their hearts, and they are not going the way of the world.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Do you feel like you are all alone, like your work is done and you haven't been successful? Don't worry or fear. God is at work. He has more for you to do. He has a disciple waiting for instruction. He has thousands that love Him more than the world. The work is not up to you. It is up to God.</p>
