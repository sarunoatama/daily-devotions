<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>July 3</h1>
<p>2 Kings 3:20-22 (NIV) <i><sup>20</sup>The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was&#8211;water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water. <sup>21</sup>Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border. <sup>22</sup>When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red&#8211;like blood.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The LORD told Elisha to have the army dig ditches, and that God was going to fill those ditches with water so the armies of Israel, Judah and Edom could drink. The next morning water flowed from the direction of Edom and filled the ditches. The able bodied men of Moab had gathered to resist the attack. When they saw the reflection of the sunrise and thought the water was the blood of the armies that had come to fight them, they rushed headlong into an ambush of ready, thirst-quenched soldiers.</p>
<p class="indent">The day before the armies in league with Israel had thought God was against them, bringing them to defeat through thirst. Instead, it was God's way of getting them to stop their plans so that He could work. We are often ready to jump into a spiritual battle, ready to take the enemy's territory, but God has His own way of doing things. He may introduce a difficulty to get us to seek His face and go His direction. The very solution to their difficulty was the means God used to trick the army of Moab. Two birds with one stone! The lesson was that the hand of God would work in their favor if they would seek His face and listen to Him.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The next time you face a dead end and feel the Lord is working against you, stop and seek His face. Find out how He would have you proceed. The difficulty may be preparation for a victory in your life.</p>
