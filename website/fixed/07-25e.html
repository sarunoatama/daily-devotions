<p>Acts 10:34-35, 44 (NIV) <i><sup>34</sup>Then Peter began to speak: "I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup>35</sup>but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>44</sup>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Up to this point in the history of the early church, the Christians were all Jewish or converts to Judaism. To help the church past their prejudices, the Lord gave Peter a vision of foods that the Jews considered unclean. He told him to eat them. Peter said he could never do such a thing. The Lord told Peter that hat He called clean, Peter should not call common.</p>
<p class="indent">In a nearby town, a very sincere Gentile worshipper of God received a vision of an angel telling him to send for Peter. At the same time, the Spirit told Peter to go with the men who were coming to look for him. Peter asked the man why he had called for him. As the man relayed the angelic vision he had seen, Peter began to get the message that God was trying to impress on his heart. You don't have to be Jewish to trust in the Messiah, Jesus, for salvation.</p>
<p class="indent">As Peter began to share the message that these Gentiles had already heard, the Holy Spirit came upon them. Peter's company was amazed that the Gentiles were given the gift of the Spirit. This was the first time they had seen Gentiles receive the Spirit. From this point on, they church would begin to see that Jesus is the Savior of the world.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you see the Gospel as pertaining to a certain group, color, class or type of people? Many years earlier, when Jesus met the woman at the well, the Samaritans declared Him to be the Savior of the world. It is the same today. Every person, rich or poor, black, yellow, or white, needs the Savior as much as you or I.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Don't hesitate to share the wonder of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection with those you come in contact. Then watch the Spirit do the work in their lives.</p>
