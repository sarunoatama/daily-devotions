<p>Matthew 4:4, 7, 10 (NIV) <i><sup>4</sup>Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'</i></p>
<p><i><sup>7</sup>Jesus answered him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'</i></p>
<p><i><sup>10</sup>Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus was tempted in every way that we are, yet without sin. After fasting for 40 days, Satan came to tempt Him. Remember that the Father had just spoken with an audible voice from heaven saying, "This is my Son." Now Satan asks, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to be turned into bread." People lose their appetite while fasting until the body begins to consume itself. Clever, the way Satan ties the doubt of who He is to His physical need. You, reader, are not the Son, but you are a son. Satan often tempts us along this same line. "If God loves you so much then why..." Jesus acted as our perfect example. He could have revealed His glory. He could have called for legions of angels, but instead, He quoted the eternal word of God. Life is more than just the physical.</p>
<p class="indent">The second temptation included the same "if". This time Satan quotes Scripture. "Take matters into your own hands Jesus. Quit waiting on the Father. Just do what it says here, throw yourself off this pinnacle. Then You, and everyone in sight, will see the angels bear You up. They'll know You are the Messiah." Jesus answers with another Scripture, "Don't put God to the test."</p>
<p class="indent">In the last revealing temptation, Satan declares that the world systems and their glory are his to give to whoever will worship him. He has always been seeking worship. He is willing to make a swap, the entire world systems for Jesus' worship. Could He skip the cross and go straight to His kingdom? No! "Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only."</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Is the Word of God your offensive weapon?</p>
