<p>2 Chronicles 27:2, 6 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done, but unlike him he did not enter the temple of the LORD. The people, however, continued their corrupt practices...</i></p>
<p><i><sup>6</sup>Jotham grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the LORD his God.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Uzziah's son, Jotham, learned from God's quick and severe dealing with his father's pride. He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and no exceptions to that are noted. The problem was in the people. Sometimes God will place a godly leader over a people whose hearts have turned away from God. His example to them should cause them to see the blessing of God is upon those who walk in His ways. Do you know someone who is full of the fruits of the Spirit? The peace and joy and patience in their life should give you a hunger to walk more closely to the LORD.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the people will not heed the example God has given them. Then you can count on future leaders to not be as godly and the nation to not be as blessed. Everyone makes choices, and those choices not only affect you but those around you. Jotham's faithfulness showered a rain of blessing upon ungodly people. Perhaps that is why he died at the young age of 41. The people did not deserve the blessing he brought them through his godly life.</p>
<p class="indent">God gave power to Jotham because of his godly life. The word 'steadfastly' is two words in Hebrew. It means to set one's direction. He laid out a course and stuck with it. He aimed for God and would not swerve off course. In Colossians 3 the Apostle Paul tells us to set our mind and heart on things above. The writer of the Hebrew epistle tells us to hold unswervingly to the course we have set. Is your course set like Jotham's was, or are you drifting? Do you know the direction of your goal, and have you decided to pursue that goal with all you have? Distractions are many and are often subtle.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Learn from both the good and bad examples of others, and keep your eye fixed upon the goal, Christ Jesus.</p>
