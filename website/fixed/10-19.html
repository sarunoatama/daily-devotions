<p>Psalms 73:24-26 (NIV) <i><sup>24</sup>You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory. <sup>25</sup>Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you. <sup>26</sup>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</i></p>

<p class="indent">In this beautiful poem, Asaph asks God why it seems the wicked have all the fun and never seem to pay the price. When he went into God's sanctuary, he understood that in the end they will meet with justice. Asaph was troubled by how bad his attitude had been while envying the wicked. He said he was like a wild beast, only concerned about the physical.</p>
<p class="indent">Then he pondered the wonder of God loving someone with such impure and selfish motives. Why would God love someone so ignorant? Why does He stay with us and hold our hand? What a wonder that He would guide us with His counsel, and afterward receive us into glory! When we consider where we are coming from and where He is taking us, it is truly miraculous. Maybe, as the Apostle Paul implied, God picks the worst just to show how amazing His power is to transform us.</p>
<p class="indent">Who do we have in heaven but God? There are those that have gone before us, but God so outshines them in all that He is and in all He has done for us, that He stands alone as our greatest desire. How could we want anything greater? Every thing the earth could offer pales by comparison. Do you have such a vision of God? Has He captured all your heart's desires? Or are you still trying to find something on the earth that satisfies?</p>
<p class="indent">Our strength and health will fail. These bodies are designed for a designated period upon this earth, but there is more to life than these bodies. The Lord is the strength of our life. Every day the king's household was served their allotted portion for their service. It may have been something like a loaf of bread, a piece of meat, and two cups of wine. In this psalm, Asaph declared that the LORD is his portion, forever. What do we receive for serving the King? Christ Jesus today, Christ Jesus tomorrow, Christ Jesus forever!</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Count on it; you'll never get tired of Him being your daily portion.</p>
