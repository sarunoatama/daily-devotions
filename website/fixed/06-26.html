<p>1 Kings 19:11-12 (NIV) <i><sup>11</sup>The LORD said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by." Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. <sup>12</sup>After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Elijah had come to the mountain of God, the place of fresh inspiration. He saw the wind so strong it broke the rocks. The ground shook with an earthquake. A fire followed the earthquake. But God had not passed by him in any of those things. Those things preceded God. God came in the gentle whisper.</p>
<p class="indent">What was this discouraged prophet learning from God's lesson to Him? Perhaps he thought the fire from heaven would transform the hearts of the people causing a national revolt and return to God. The rain had been a physical sign that God was working through Elijah. Surely they would all listen then. But all those physical things only preceded the real work of God, His whisper to each and every heart. That is where the real change comes.</p>
<p class="indent">Man is always seeking some great physical sign or manifestation. We want to see and hear and feel something that will move our senses. God may precede a work in that manner. If people are too immature or off track it may be necessary. But what follows is really where God is. He is in the voice that speaks to the heart and brings a change of attitude to the heart. That is where individuals and nations are changed. God is about to whisper a word to Elijah that will change the course of nations.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are you looking for the spectacular and forgetting the power of the whisper? Listen! Be still and know He is God. Realize the power of His whisper to change your life and that of those you come in contact with each day. He may even whisper through you.</p>
