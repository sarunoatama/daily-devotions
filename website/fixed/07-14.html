<p>2 Kings 22:19-20 (NIV) <i><sup>19</sup>Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people, that they would become accursed and laid waste, and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD. <sup>20</sup>Therefore I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.'" So they took her answer back to the king.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Hezekiah's son, Manasseh, reigned for 55 years. The worst king of Judah followed the best. His was the longest reign and the most wicked. He put idols in the temple and offered his sons as burnt sacrifices. He restored all the idolatry his father had destroyed. Manasseh's son, Amon, was just like him. His officials assassinated him.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally the kingdom returned to a man with a heart like David's. Josiah was only eight when he began to reign. He ordered the restoration of the temple. People with a heart after God are concerned about the worship of God in their nation. During the restoration of the temple, the Book of the Law was found. When it was read to Josiah, he tore his robes and repented before God. He feared the wrath of God that would come upon them because of what his father and grandfather had done. He sent to inquire of a prophetess, and she gave him the answer that is the text for today.</p>
<p class="indent">Is your heart responsive to the word like Josiah's was? Do you humble yourself before the LORD realizing that it is only His grace that saves us from wrath? If so, you can expect the LORD to be as gracious to you. If not, God will do whatever it takes to turn your heart toward Him. His wrath is His mercy to turn us back to the place that is best for our eternal good and His eternal glory.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Is my heart open to conviction by the Word of God?</p>
