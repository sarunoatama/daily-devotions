<p>Matthew 7:13-14 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. <sup>14</sup>But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Contrary to popular humanist opinion, the Master teacher taught that few people have found the path to life. The world is telling us that all paths lead to life. It is teaching that your path is just as good as any other. Jesus flat out contradicts that idea. There is no way around His statement of fact. Either this man, whom the world respects as a great teacher, was totally off base, or postmodern thinking is dead wrong. Consider the fact that Jesus' teaching has stood strong for 2000 years, and postmodern teaching is just another idea in the constantly changing teachings from the intellect of man.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a challenge to every person to consider where he or she is headed. Jesus gave only two alternatives, destruction or life. Chances are you are on the road to destruction. Isn't that what He taught? The majority enters the broad gate. Have you found the narrow gate? Are you sure? And what about your loved ones? Have they found it? Jesus taught clearly in John chapter ten that He is the narrow gate. We must go through Him to find life.</p>
<p class="indent">Some folks want to think the broad road doesn't lead to destruction. Look around you. How many healthy, wholesome homes do you know of? I'm talking about homes where the parents love and spend time with their children, and where the children respect their parents, where all recognize and honor the Word of God. Now do you see that the gate is broad that leads to destruction? Those homes are a rarity. Those homes filled with strife and anger, bitterness and rivalry are many. Sin destroys, and that is why the love of God sent His Son to save us from it.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: He is the narrow gate. Enter in and be transformed. Enter in and set your feet on the path of life. Guide your family in, and be whole.</p>
