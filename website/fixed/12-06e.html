<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>December 6</h1>
<p>1 Peter 4:7-8 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray. <sup>8</sup>Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.</i></p>

<p class="indent">If the end was near then, it is certainly much nearer now. The end of the Temple worship system and the world as they knew it was at hand. Our world can change in a moment also. When chaos strikes, if we are not clear minded and self-controlled, we will be swept along with the crowd. We should be praying for God's people and those in the valley of decision. We should be looking for opportunities to share with those seeking answers. Only when the Spirit of God is our guide through daily life, will we be able to hear His guidance when our world goes mad.</p>
<p class="indent">Peter reminds us that love is to be the one gift we place above all others. This love is not the fickle kind that demands a certain response or it will be withdrawn. This is a love that covers a multitude of sins. It is a love that is willing to overlook offenses against you. Peter calls it a deep love. It should be as deep as the well of Christ's love for you. What He has given you He expects you to pass on to others.</p>
<p class="indent">Love is the one thing that will keep your priorities straight when things fall apart. It will help you avoid the natural instinct to put yourself first instead of being aware of the needs around you. This is the kind of love Jesus demonstrated in Gethsemene. "If it is me you are seeking, then let these go." He was clear minded and self-controlled. He was able to pray in preparation for the time of trouble. He overlooked His disciples' desertion because of His deep love for them.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, please help me to always be clear minded and self-controlled so that I can pray. Help me to let your deep love flow to my brothers and sister in Christ that I may be ready to forgive.</p>
