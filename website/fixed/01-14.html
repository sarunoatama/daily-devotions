<p>Genesis 15:10-12 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. <sup>11</sup>Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. <sup>12</sup>As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.</i></p>

<p class="indent">God entered into a covenant that was an ancient ritual in Abram's day. It was to verify an inheritance or to confirm an alliance. Animals were cut in half, and each party would walk through the blood. They were in picture saying, "If either party breaks the agreement (covenant) let us be like these animals, chopped in half and our blood shed." In this case, God alone walked through the blood while Abram was in a deep sleep. It meant that God had promised to pay with His own blood if either party broke the agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">The parties involved would often exchange weapons. That meant that your enemies are now mine and mine are yours. We will fight beside and for each other. They would also exchange their purses. Your wealth is available to my need and mine for yours. Again, since Abraham did not go through the blood, this is a very one-sided agreement. God has committed Himself to protect and provide for Abraham and his descendents. What a promise for Abraham and his heirs, who we are by faith! (Galatians 3:29)</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the covenant had to be reconfirmed if there was doubt as to the commitment of either party. The confirming of the covenant would be to exchange sons. The son of Abram was offered on Mount Moriah, and so was the Son of God. God so loved the world He gave His one and only Son. Abram's descendants did break the covenant over and over. Eventually when the perfect time had come, God did pay with His own blood on the cross.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: God is my Protector and my Provider. He confirmed His covenant by giving His own Son. What a gracious God!</p>
