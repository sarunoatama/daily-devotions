<p>Psalms 56:2-4 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>My slanderers pursue me all day long; many are attacking me in their pride. <sup>3</sup>When I am afraid, I will trust in you. <sup>4</sup>In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?</i></p>

<p class="indent">There are times in life when it seems the whole world has unjustly conspired against you. Slander can turn your good reputation into one in which people unwittingly believe lies about you. Those who join together to bring you down have believed the slander and think they are serving a righteous cause. It is their pride that tells them they are more righteous than you, and therefore they must see that you are removed from the place of respect that your life has earned.</p>
<p class="indent">It can seem that life is out of control, that evil has a free reign. That is a fearful thought. If there is no justice, if lies can destroy the innocent, what hope is there of any kind of godly achievement in life? That would cause anyone to fear. But when we are afraid, we need to look to where all power truly lies. It is not in the power of slander. It is not in evil destructive powers, even though it may appear so at the moment. To God belongs power and might. Those who trust in Him are never disappointed. We turn to His unfailing promises and find faith that moves us beyond the present to the promised outcome.</p>
<p class="indent">When we see life from this perspective, we can say with David, "What can mortal man do to me?" He can lie, slander, and deceive, why, he can even beat and kill my mortal body, but all power and might belong to God. I will be eternally rewarded for my trust in Him. My enemies will either be conquered by Him, as I was, and become my brothers, or they will be punished for their rebellion against His love and truth. Every knee will bow! Either way, righteousness and truth will prevail. I can count on it. His word has never failed and it never will.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: When you are afraid, trust in Him. What can mortal man do to you?</p>
