<p>Ezekiel 37:3-5 (NIV) <i><sup>3</sup>He asked me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" I said, "O Sovereign LORD, you alone know." <sup>4</sup>Then he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones and say to them, 'Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! <sup>5</sup>This is what the Sovereign LORD says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Ezekiel was prophesying to the people of Israel who did not have the life of God in them. They went into captivity a depraved people that were a horrible example of people in covenant with the one true God. What is needed to change our testimony from a bad example to one that honors the name we bear? What can bring life to our lifeless existence? Only the Spirit of God can make the difference.</p>
<p class="indent">The Word of God must be heard. "Breath" is the same in Hebrew as "wind" or "spirit". The Spirit of God must be breathed into us. Do you remember that it was the breath of God that brought life to Adam (Genesis 2:7)? And do you remember that Jesus breathed upon His disciples and told them to receive the Spirit (John 20:22)?</p>
<p class="indent">In this passage God is dealing with His people Israel. It is by His command that the breath of God brings life. In the New Testament we are told that the Father longs to give the Holy Spirit to those who will but ask (Luke 11:13). If you recognize your spiritual life is lifeless, that it needs a power beyond yourself, if you need to be restored from scattered bones to a living breathing being, ask the Father. He longs to give good things to His children when they just ask.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Will you receive the breath of God today!</p>
