<p>Psalms 116:12-13 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>How can I repay the LORD for all his goodness to me? <sup>13</sup>I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">God is good! When I am in touch with reality enough to see how good God has been to me, I am convicted to respond in some way. A vision of the goodness of God only comes by the grace of God. Left on our own, we would focus only on what was not pleasing us at the moment. The flesh is extremely negative and loves to be critical. But when the grace of God opens our eyes for a moment, when He breaks through that veil of darkness that our carnal nature casts over our vision, we see His great goodness. Once we see it, we are overwhelmed with wonder that He could be so good to rebellious creatures like us.</p>
<p class="indent">Then we start to think about the appropriate response. If someone lavished upon you sacrificial goodness, after you have ignored their attention a thousand times before, if your heart is somehow enabled to see the love that prompted all that goodness, you want to respond. Take a moment to look at the cross. See Him hanging there in agony for YOU! Now open the eyes of your spirit and see Him standing in front of you with His nail pierced hands stretched out to receive you into His loving embrace. How will you respond?</p>
<p class="indent">Take the cup of salvation! Drink every last drop. Call on His name, Jeshua, salvation of Jehovah! "Save me, cleanse me, make me wholly Yours. Fill me, change me, use me as You will. I give you this life that has lived selfishly up till now, to do with as You will.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: That is my only appropriate response to all the goodness You have lavished upon me. <i>I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD."</i></p>
