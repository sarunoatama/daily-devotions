<p>Hebrews 2:14,17-18 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death&#8211;that is, the devil&#8211;</i></p>
<p><i><sup>17</sup>For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. <sup>18</sup>Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</i></p>

<p class="indent">It is important for us to understand that Jesus was all man. That does not change the fact that He was all God, but in every way He was made like us. He was one of us. He had flesh and blood. He had Mary's lineage. He was tempted. He had to endure just like we have to endure.</p>
<p class="indent">When Adam lost the dominion of earth to the devil in the Garden, God promised the offspring of the woman would one day crush that devil's head, his authority. That offspring had to be flesh and blood to take back what flesh and blood gave up. He is the Second Adam in that He took back what the first Adam lost. The sin of the first Adam brought death to all. The Second Adam came and provided life to all, by destroying him who held the power of death.</p>
<p class="indent">As a man enduring all the temptations and sufferings that we face, He can give the perfect counsel. He faced the same things and yet came through in sinless victory. What better priest could we hope for? All others have failed like us. How can we be sure of the answers they give us? But Jesus became the merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, giving us God's direction and presenting our requests to God. As He intercedes, He can convey our feelings and difficulties in complete harmony with how we mean them, because He has been where we are. That is why He is the one person that can help you in whatever your need is. He is the One that can perfectly understand your heart and present it to God with mercy and faithfulness. He made it possible through the atonement that He provided in His flesh and blood body.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: When you pray, understand that He knows exactly how you feel.</p>
