<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>June 25</h1>
<p>John 14:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>"Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. <sup>2</sup>In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. <sup>3</sup>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus had just told the disciples He was leaving. He told Peter that he would deny Him, and followed those words with the passage for this evening. <i>"Do not let..."</i> is telling them that they can choose to not allow their hearts to enter into turmoil. Few Christians today believe this! Jesus was telling them that in the worst imaginable scenario, they could choose to not allow their hearts to be disquieted. They could remain calm and firm in their convictions in the face of their Master being tortured to death. How in the world is that possible?</p>
<p class="indent">He told them how, <i>"Trust in God; trust also in me."</i> Trust, or believe, in both God the Father's sovereignty over all, and Jesus' choice to go the direction He was led by His Father. The sovereignty of God, His will after all is said and done, is a great source of peace to the people of God. No matter what you face, if you know the God who loves you will have His way in the end, you can peacefully endure all things. It is when we place our trust in our self that we should be disturbed! Where is your trust placed today?</p>
<p class="indent">In Jesus' day, a suitor would ask his prospective bride to wait for him while he added a room onto his father's house. Once the room was completed, he would return with his friends for a weeklong wedding party. Then they would return to the new room to live together. He would tell her something very similar to verses 2 and 3 above. Jesus is not leading you on. He can't lie. He is preparing a place for you. He will be back to receive you to Himself so that you can forever be with Him. It should cause us amazement to consider that He so desires us to be with Him. Don't let your heart doubt or be in fear. The One who cannot lie has promised a wonderful new beginning, eternally in His presence, in a special relationship with Him.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Trust! Believe! Do not let your heart be troubled.</p>
