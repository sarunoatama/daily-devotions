<p>1 Chronicles 29:1 (NIV) <i>Then King David said to the whole assembly: "My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this palatial structure is not for man but for the LORD God.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">David gave, and then he gave some more. The tonnage of precious metals is incredible! And when David asked, <i>"Now, who is willing to consecrate himself today to the LORD?"</i> 1 Chronicles 29:5 (NIV), the leaders also gave in abundance. <i>The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly.</i> 1 Chronicles 29:9 (NIV) Everyone seemed to be totally devoted to making the house of the LORD the most amazing and costly structure ever built<i>.</i></p>
<p class="indent">This passage is a favorite of those raising funds to build new church buildings. Let us never forget that we are speaking of people, living stones, that make up the temple today. The Temple Solomon built was a wonderful, a God inspired illustration of what God desires. David referred to it as God's footstool. The prophet said that heaven is God's throne and earth His footstool so what kind of house can you build Him? (Acts 7:48) The task is indeed great. In fact, all this gold and silver and precious stones, all the labor of gifted and anointed men could only erect a shadow of the real temple.</p>
<p class="indent">The task is great, but now we have the Son of David (Jesus) to do the building. Unlike Solomon, the Son of David is experienced. Will we give of ourselves and our resources to see that the real temple of living stones is built, like they gave to see a passing shadow built? How much more should we be willing to give our treasures and talents to the real thing!</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: There is surely someone in your life that the Master Builder is transforming into a living stone. How can you give to see the work is completed?</p>
