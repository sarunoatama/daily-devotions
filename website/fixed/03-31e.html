<p>Matthew 26:27-29 (NIV) <i><sup>27</sup>Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you. <sup>28</sup>This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. <sup>29</sup>I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom."</i></p>

<p class="indent">At the Last Supper, Jesus did something out of the norm for the traditional Seder of the day. The traditional meal had four cups of wine. Each has a name and spiritual significance. The cup that Jesus was presenting in our text above was the Cup of Redemption. In the past, it had reminded the people of the blood of the lambs that marked the doorposts in Egypt. The destroying angel saw the marked doors and passed over them. Instead of the regular phrases that were repeated here, He told them the cup was about His blood! Some manuscripts include the word 'new' before 'covenant'. In 1 Corinthians 11, Paul quoted it with the words 'new covenant'. What did Jesus mean?</p>
<p class="indent">The old covenant was the covenant made on Mount Sinai. It was made with the blood of animals and dependent on the rules being kept. The prophets told of a day when God would make a new covenant. God promised to make one that was not written on stone tablets but written on the transformed heart of the recipient. That day had come.</p>
<p class="indent">There is another nuance here that we would only catch if we were familiar with traditions of the day. The wording is very much like a proposal for marriage. A groom would present a cup of wine to a prospective bride and propose a covenant of relationship with her. If she took it and drank it all, it meant she received his life and would give him her life as well.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the dearest expressions of all is the last verse. Wine was a symbol of joy and celebration. Jesus said He would not drink it again until He drank it anew with us in the Father's kingdom. We long to be with Him, but this expression tells us how He longs to be with us. That should reveal to our hearts His great love for us.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: The next time you have communion, remember the meaning behind these rich symbols and words.</p>
