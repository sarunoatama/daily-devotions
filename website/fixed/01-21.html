<p>Genesis 22:1-2 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied. <sup>2</sup>Then God said, "Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Isaac was one of the greatest foreshadows of Christ. Throughout this story, we have pictures of what will happen in the life of Jesus. Isaac's birth was miraculous. He is the son of promise, the only son, whom his father loved. On the mountain Moriah (same place Jesus was sacrificed), he carried the wood for his execution. Since Abraham is well over 100, I assume the boy was willingly bound by his father, just as Jesus willingly went to the cross. We will not read of Isaac again until he receives his bride. These are amazing parallels for us to see that God is in the details and knows the end from the beginning.</p>
<p class="indent">In this passage, God is said to test Abraham. God does not tempt us, but He does test us (James 1:13). God will test us to strengthen our resolve and to help us realize where we are in our growth in Him. His tests help us get off the fence and stand squarely in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="indent">He calls us by name. He speaks just as clearly today as He did to Abraham. What seemed like a great burden, and to be inconsistent with God's character, turned out to be a great blessing. It is now a great badge of honor that Abraham believed God's promise to the extent that he knew God would raise Isaac from the dead (Hebrews 11:19). He told his servants "WE will return to you (22:5)."</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: What has God promised you? Will you lay it down and trust God to bring it about in His way and time? Can you surrender it back to God, like faithful Abraham did?</p>
