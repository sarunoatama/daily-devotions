<p>Joshua 2:10-11 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed. <sup>11</sup>When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Of all the people in this city, this harlot named Rahab was the one who wanted the true God. They all heard the stories of how God had been with Israel, and they were all fearful, but only Rahab had the sense to align herself with that God.</p>
<p class="indent">Your testimony is one of your most powerful witnesses that your God is God in heaven above and earth below. Perhaps you do not have amazing stories like the Israelites did, but a godly life is an amazing story in itself. The fruits of the Spirit have their own attractive testimony. Honest people know they are evidence of God! If you have an impressive story of deliverance tell it. Don't underestimate the testimony of a godly life.</p>
<p class="indent">There are Rahabs out there in the world watching and discerning. We should watch for them also so that we can tell them the wonder of the God who delivered us and goes before us through life. The Spirit of God goes before us, preparing hearts to be receptive. Rahab became a part of the lineage of Jesus. You never know how your testimony will affect lives. The ramifications are usually much wider than we can imagine.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help the testimony of my life lead people to You.</p>
