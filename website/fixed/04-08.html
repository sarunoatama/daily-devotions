<p>Deuteronomy 15:1, 7-8 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>7</sup>If there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the land that the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor brother. <sup>8</sup>Rather be openhanded and freely lend him whatever he needs.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Jewish faith was intensely practical. Anyone may fall on hard times and need assistance. This was to be a nation where they generously helped one another. The Kingdom of God is such a place. If you have extra, it is to share with those who have a need so that you both will be blessed. If he can't repay after a period of time, forgive the debt. Don't hold it against him.</p>
<p class="indent">Is it more blessed to give than receive? It is, only if you can do it with a generous spirit thanking the Lord. The Law put them under compulsion to do this, and at many times in Israel's history they disregarded the Law. The Spirit puts us under compulsion too, but asks us to have a willing heart. All we need to do is yield to the Spirit and He will give us that kind of a generous heart that is the heart of our Lord.</p>
<p class="indent">Is there a person in your fellowship with a need? Lend freely in an openhanded way. Our New Testament faith should be very practical also. The world should see a testimony of how we care for one another. If you've done it to your brother, you have done it to Christ.</p>
<p class="comment">Pray: Lord, give me a generous spirit like yours. Help me desire treasures in heaven more than treasure upon the earth.</p>
