<p>1 Chronicles 11:10-11 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>These were the chiefs of David's mighty men&#8211;they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the LORD had promised&#8211; <sup>11</sup>this is the list of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was chief of the officers; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.</i></p>

<p class="indent">David had a very large following of mighty men. These men began gathering around David when he fled from Saul. Why did they come to him? He had nothing to offer them. They were a bit like the old gangs whom people paid protection money, only they actually did protect people. In the account of their protection of Nabal, David could say that they took nothing from him. They may have been men of ill repute but they were willing to follow David's example. Surely David shared with them his love for God. If nothing else, they learned of it in his psalms, many of which David wrote while on the run from Saul.</p>
<p class="indent">I think there was another thing that drew them; David was anointed. The presence of God was with him. In his words and actions, there was something different, something of God. When a man or woman commits himself or herself completely to God, there is a fire of dedication that draws people. People come to watch them burn while wondering if they can have such a zeal for God. The mighty men of David followed David's example of standing by faith in the power of God against impossible enemies. Their faith was strengthened by his example, and they had a testimony all their own.</p>
<p class="indent">Your faith can be contagious and inspire others to trust in God. Nothing short of complete dedication is going to catch the attention of others. Extraordinary faith comes from an extraordinary relationship. We see David's extraordinary relationship with God in the psalms.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help me to enter into that kind of extraordinary relationship with You.</p>
