<p>Revelation 3:15-16, 20 (NIV) <i><sup>15</sup>I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! <sup>16</sup>So, because you are lukewarm&#8211;neither hot nor cold&#8211;I am about to spit you out of my mouth.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>20</sup>Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus dictated the last letter to the church of Laodicea. Though these were actual churches in Asia Minor, some believe that these represent different periods of church history, Laodicea being the last and one that we are currently in.</p>
<p class="indent">The indictment against them was that they were content in their physical abundance. They were not on fire with desire to love and serve God, neither were they anti-God. They were just disinterested. The opposite of love is not hate; it is apathy. They thought they had this world's goods and the promise of heaven too.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus told them that they did not realize that they were really naked and blind and poor. Contentment in this world had numbed them to their true spiritual condition.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus gave them the solution. Come to Him and receive true wealth, righteous clothing, and eye medicine so they could see. He asks them to answer the door. Today He's knocking but we are too busy with the things of the world. If we will just get up and let Him in, everything would change. Maybe we are too comfortable to get up. His words may disturb us too much. We may see our true condition and realize there must be a change, so we leave Him outside. He longs to sit and eat with us in sweet fellowship, and heal us of our lukewarm spirit. Let Him in right now; take the time to dine with Him and hear what He has to say to you.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: He's knocking. How will you respond?</p>
