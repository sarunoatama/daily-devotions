<p>John 9:31-33 (NIV) <i><sup>31</sup>We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will. <sup>32</sup>Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. <sup>33</sup>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</i></p>

<p class="indent">John chapter 8 ended with Jesus declaring His eternal existence and the Jews trying to stone Him. In chapter 9 we find that He has not fled but remained hidden in the crowds. He healed the eyes of a man who had been born blind. The people brought the healed man to the religious leaders to show them the amazing thing that had been done. Because Jesus made mud to put on the man's eyes on the Sabbath day, the leaders were convinced He was not a godly man. Then they questioned whether or not the man was actually born blind.</p>
<p class="indent">Their tradition taught that the miraculous authenticated the words and mission of the prophet, but their interpretation of the law was that a godly person would not do a healing work on the Sabbath. Instead of examining their convictions, they set out to prove it didn't really happen or that Jesus was evil. Sometimes we are so stuck in our misconceptions, that even when reality slaps us in the face, we can't stop and reconsider our convictions.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of rejoicing with the man who could now miraculously see, the leaders continued to cross-examine him. Finally he gave them the answer that is the verse for this evening. "Why can't you decide if this man is of God or not? God doesn't answer the requests of sinners but of people who do His will. This miracle had never been seen before! If He wasn't of God how could He have done such a thing?" Instead of following the man's simple logic, the leaders insulted him and threw him out (may mean they would no longer allow Him access to the Temple). His words must have struck a very raw nerve.</p>
<p class="indent">This was one of the unique signs that Jesus was indeed the Messiah. When the Holy Spirit brings conviction to our lives, we must take caution that we do not follow the Pharisees' pattern of justification, denial, and attack. The man who had been blind found Jesus and believed Him to be the Messiah. He received both physical and spiritual sight, while the leaders stayed in spiritual darkness.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help us to humble ourselves and admit when we are wrong.</p>
