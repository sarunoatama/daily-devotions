<p>1 Chronicles 19:13 (NIV) <i><sup>13</sup>Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">After David was established as king, he heard about the death of the king of the Ammonites. He sent a group of Israelites to express sympathy. The new king's advisors suggested that this display of sympathy was really to spy out the land. They cut off the beard and robes of the ambassadors, a sign of great humiliation in that day, and sent them back. When the Ammonites realized this might cause retaliation they hired the Arameans as mercenaries.</p>
<p class="indent">David's general, Joab, led the troops against them but the two enemy armies were able to set up armies in front and behind Joab. Joab divided his army and put one group to fight in front and the other behind. Whichever group was successful was to turn and help the others. That is when the verse we have today was uttered. The odds did not look good. Joab reminded them they were fighting for the people and the cities of their God. That made it personal for each soldier. It wasn't just about their own life; it was for their family, too.</p>
<p class="indent">We realize our battle affects many more than just us personally. How many fallen had forgotten how their entire family and those of their city are affected by their battle? We do the best we can in the situation God has placed us. We rely on His strength. Then we trust that God will do what is good in His sight. God did help them, and both enemy armies retreated. The LORD did what was good in His sight.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Your spiritual battle is for your family and your city. Encourage yourself with the fact that if you do your part, the LORD will certainly do His.</p>
