<p>2 Chronicles 35:20-22 (NIV) <i><sup>20</sup>After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle. <sup>21</sup>But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, "What quarrel is there between you and me, O king of Judah? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you." <sup>22</sup>Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Neco had said at God's command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Josiah had been a godly king and restored the temple worship, but the prophet had told him God's judgments were inevitable. In our passage today, Josiah does what seemed good, but not at God's leading. In fact, God warned him through the mouth of a heathen king. Carchemish must have been an ally of Judah and it seemed to make sense to fight together their common threat, Egypt. The words of the king of Egypt should have given Josiah a check to seek God's plan. When we step out on our own, with our own reason, we can place ourselves in harms way. God is faithful to warn us, even through the lips of an unbeliever. Remember in Jesus' day when the High Priest said, "It is better for one man to die than the nation to perish"? Though he did not know it, it was a prophetic word.</p>
<p class="indent">We shouldn't ignore what unbelievers say when they are rebuking us. It may be the Lord. I have heard unbelievers say, "I thought you trusted in God." Ouch. God will use those who are unbelievers to remind us to look to Him.</p>
<p class="indent">Josiah was a great king and gave the nation one more chance to turn back to God, but he put himself in a position to be taken out of the scene early by not being sensitive to God's warnings.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: The rebuke from an unbeliever may come at the Lord's command.</p>
