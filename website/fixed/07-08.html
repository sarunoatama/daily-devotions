<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>July 8</h1>
<p>2 Kings 6:15-17 (NIV) <i><sup>15</sup>When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. "Oh, my lord, what shall we do?" the servant asked. <sup>16</sup>"Don't be afraid," the prophet answered. "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them." <sup>17</sup>And Elisha prayed, "O LORD, open his eyes so he may see." Then the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.</i></p>

<p class="indent">When the king of Aram warred against Israel, Elisha sent word to the king of Israel informing him of the places Aram's army would camp. The king of Aram thought one of his generals was a spy. When he learned it was the prophet Elisha that knew by Divine power what his plans were, he surrounded the city to capture Elisha.</p>
<p class="indent">The servant of Elisha got up that morning and saw the army surrounding the city in wait for them. He was scared, but Elisha wasn't. Elisha could see in the spirit. That is why he knew where the enemy camped. That is why he knew he did not need to fear. Then Elisha asked God to let his servant see what he could see. There in the hills around them was a much greater army, a spiritual army. The hills were full of horses with chariots of fire.</p>
<p class="indent">If we look in the carnal realm, we see only what looks to be too great for us. Enemies seem to have the upper hand. Situations look impossible. Odds appear to be too great. But if we will let God open our eyes of faith so that we can see in the spirit, we will see resources that our enemy has no idea we have.</p>
<p class="indent">Elisha single handedly (through the power of God) captured this army. That is because one person and God are a majority. It doesn't matter how great the numbers are against you, as long as God is on your side and you are listening to and obeying Him.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, open my eyes, so that I can see the reality of the spiritual realm.</p>
