<p>Ezra 10:10-12 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt. <sup>11</sup>Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives." <sup>12</sup>The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: "You are right! We must do as you say.</i></p>

<p class="indent">When Ezra had heard how the remnant had broken God's law by marrying the women of the land, he tore his robes and wept and fasted. The people followed his lead and were convicted of sin. It was the people who encouraged him to tell them what to do to set things right with God. Ezra replied with the verses above; confess and do God's will. Separate yourselves from the people and wives who had those horrible demonic religious practices.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not live in Israel and were never forbidden to marry a certain group of people, but the principle remains true. That is why the Apostle Paul told us not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers. That could apply to marriage or business. When we find we are with people of evil practices, we should not commit ourselves to any type of united endeavor with them. How can two walk together except they be agreed?</p>
<p class="indent">But there is a deeper principle. What fellowship does light have with darkness? If we are walking in the light, we will be repulsed by the sin and have a desire to show them the way to be freed from its bondage. Some Christians will play on the edge of the cliff of sin because the allurement is enticing them. Coach Bill McCartney said, "Draw a line where there is a danger of being caught by sin and stay ten yards back." Don't walk along the very edge of a cliff.</p>
<p class="indent">In this final chapter of Ezra, the men sent their foreign wives and children away. That seems very harsh of God, but the situation existed because of disobedience to God. It was the only remedy. Not dealing with the issue had caused the downfall of Israel in the past. We must cut off from our lives the thing that is enticing us to sin, and send it away from our lives if we are going to go on with God.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: If you want God's blessing, confess the sin. Do God's will. Separate yourself from the sin.</p>
