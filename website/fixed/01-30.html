<p>Exodus 3:11-12 (NIV) <i><sup>11</sup>But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?" <sup>12</sup>And God said, "I will be with you."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Indeed, who is anyone that we should be sent by Almighty God as His messengers? That is a great wonder to the humbled servant of God, that God could use a person like me. The Apostle Paul understood it as much as anyone when he said that God chose him, the worst sinner, to demonstrate the greatness of God. We can say with Moses and Paul, "Who am I?" Sinners saved by grace! It demonstrates that God can use anything when He uses us.</p>
<p class="indent">We must not stop in just seeing our weakness, but must go on to look upon God's all-sufficiency. What does it matter that I am limited? God is not limited! And if He has sent me, then He must empower me. Moses explained to God (as if God was unaware) that he was not a gifted speaker. God answered, "Who made man's mouth!" We can credit Moses with being humble, but obviously he needed to learn some lessons in the ability of God to use our physical being as His instrument (Romans 6:13).</p>
<p class="indent"><i>"But Whom shall I say has sent me?" </i>Moses asked. God answered, <i>"Tell them I Am that I Am has sent you." </i>The 'I Am' in Hebrew is Jehovah, the eternal God. He is the One to Whom the past, present, and future are always now. It seems strange for man to question the Eternal God, yet how typical of man. We want to know how God will do it. We want to know ahead of time how to face situations, because we have so little faith. We fear we will be embarrassed.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider:<i>"I will be with you."</i> Isn't that enough for you to trust Him for the outcome?</p>
