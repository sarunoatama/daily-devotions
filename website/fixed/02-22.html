<p>Exodus 33:18-19 (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>Then Moses said, "Now show me your glory." <sup>19</sup>And the LORD said, "I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Once Moses was promised that the Presence of God would be with Him, he asked to see the glory of God. The LORD placed him in a cleft of a rock and covered him with his hand and let Moses glance at what was referred to as God's backside.</p>
<p class="indent">Just what did Moses see? God is invisible, for He is a Spirit. The manifest Presence of God is Jesus. (Colossians 1:15) But why all the caution and protection to see Jesus? He was in His normal state, as opposed to His earthly condition. His normal state is to be clothed in glory. A glance at the brilliance of that glory was enough to make Moses' face to glow with the after affects of that radiance. After catching that glimpse of Jesus in His glory, he had to put a veil over his face so the people could talk with him.</p>
<p class="indent">Observe what God called His glory. He said, <i>"I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you...". </i>It was the goodness of God that Moses viewed. Certainly Jesus is the goodness of God toward us. It is as if goodness and glory are synonymous. Now consider the fact that the glory of God is in all the earth. (Isaiah 6:3) We could say that His goodness is in all the earth.</p>
<p class="indent">Is there a place where the Lord Jesus is not working? Is there any corner of the globe where mercy is not reaching out? We do live in a fallen world, but the wonder is that the goodness of God is at work in every corner of it. Some choose to see only the darkness. Others have eyes to see the goodness of God in all His various ministries, everywhere they go. You can tell who those people are. Their faces glow.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help me to see your glory and goodness that my face might reflect You.</p>
