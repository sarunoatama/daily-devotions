<p>Deuteronomy 10:12-13 (NIV) <i><sup>12</sup>And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, <sup>13</sup>and to observe the Lord's commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?</i></p>

<p class="indent">God only asks us that which is for our good. In this passage, He asks us five things for our good. The first is to fear the LORD our God. The fear of the LORD causes us to distance ourselves from evil. To fear God means to know He is just and will punish all rebellion against His goodness.</p>
<p class="indent">Then He asks us to walk in His ways. What are the ways of God? His attributes define the ways of God: justice, mercy, truth, righteousness, grace, love, holiness, and goodness. When we walk in His ways, we are in His likeness. Walking in His ways has lasting results. It is the best for us and for those whom we come in contact.</p>
<p class="indent">Next is to love Him. We love Him because He first loved us. When that is done, all is done. To love Him means the other instructions are carried out as well. God wants a living relationship with you, not just obedience to rituals.</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth is to serve the LORD our God with all our heart and soul. If we love Him we will want to express that love. Love that is not expressed in service is insincere. Does your wholehearted service express your love relationship with God?</p>
<p class="indent">Last is to observe His commands. It's not because God is a dictator, but because His commands are instructions of love that show you the best way to go. The two great commands are to love God with our all, and our neighbor as our self.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, teach me to fear You, walk in Your ways, serve, love, and obey You.</p>
