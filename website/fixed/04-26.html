<p>Joshua 9:14-15 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>The men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD. <sup>15</sup>Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.</i></p>

<p class="indent">After Israel conquered Ai, the Hivites that occupied nearby towns concocted a deception to save their lives. They sent a group of men that pretended they had come on a long journey. They had bags of moldy bread and looked travel weary. Actually they were the next towns that Israel would battle.</p>
<p class="indent">The leaders of Israel saw the dry wineskins, the patched sandals, and the worn bags with moldy bread and believed their story. Besides, it was kind of uplifting to hear how people in far off lands had heard the testimony of what God was doing for them. Great testimony wasn't it?</p>
<p class="indent">They ate together and made a treaty with these deceivers. They had believed what their eyes had seen instead of consulting with the LORD. Now there was nothing they could do but put those people to work serving Israel. They could not take their lands as God had purposed for them.</p>
<p class="indent">Satan is the Great Deceiver. He often brings in subtle lies that make you feel good about yourself. It may even look like it is giving glory to God. We must consult the LORD. We must ask God to lead and not be led by our natural senses. We are easily tricked, but God is never deceived. He will always give us the best advice. It may not be a total loss, but it is not the highest and best that God had planned for us. Consult God in His Word, in prayer, through godly counsel and walk by faith not by sight.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Am I trusting God, or my senses?</p>
