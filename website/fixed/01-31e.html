<p>Matthew 5:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. <sup>7</sup>Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. <sup>8</sup>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</i></p>

<p class="indent">While on the mountain with his disciples, Jesus taught them about the Kingdom of heaven way of seeing things. Most of the Hebrew world had a future hope of bliss in the afterlife, but Jesus said people are filled with goodness right now. What kind of people? The ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be filled. He didn't say they might attain it. No! They will be filled! The Greek sense in this expression is that of continually being satisfied with the righteousness of God. That fullness is used to create an increasing desire, which is in turn satiated with more of the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="indent">The merciful take on the heartaches of those who are suffering. They mourn with those who mourn, feeling their sorrow. That person will reap what they have sown. When they are sorrowful, people will comfort them, sharing their pain.</p>
<p class="indent">The pure in heart are those who continually come to God for His cleansing. They see their need and know the solution to it is the wonderfully gracious forgiveness of God. They're continually coming for cleansing, and their desire to increase in holiness is rewarded with an increasing revelation of God.</p>
<p class="indent">The perspective of man is that those who hunger and thirst for righteousness might be filled if they do all the right things. Jesus says the desire is the key, not a perfect performance. Man's perspective is to be happy about possessions. Why share some unfortunate person's pain? Jesus tells us we are fulfilled and insure our own comfort when we share other's pain. Man's perspective is the pure in heart are full of head-knowledge. He thinks a lucky revelation has happened upon some unsuspecting person giving him secret wisdom. Kingdom thinking is that the pure heart is rewarded with the revelation of a very personal God.</p>
