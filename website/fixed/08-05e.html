<p>Romans 1:18-20 (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, <sup>19</sup>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. <sup>20</sup>For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities&#8211;his eternal power and divine nature&#8211;have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Paul said God's wrath is being revealed. It is a present but also progressive revelation. They could see the consequences of sin on the physical and emotional state of those who were given over to it. You can too, if you are discerning. Shortly after Paul died, the Temple was destroyed. That generation of Jews who had rejected the Messiah and persecuted His followers would soon be persecuted by Rome, reaping what they had sown. The wrath of God could be seen in the physical afflictions of the pagan cultures as well. STDs were rampant because of Greek temple prostitution.</p>
<p class="indent">Did the Gentile cultures have an excuse for not knowing right from wrong? Paul wrote that what might be known about God was made plain to them. God made it plain. God has revealed to every culture and individual what they need to know about Him. His eternal power and divine nature are clearly seen and understood through His creation. No one has an excuse. As we see that revelation and the Spirit works on our heart, we must come to a decision of whether or not to surrender to the God of creation or serve our lusts.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been said that God has given us three revelations, creation, the Bible, and the life of Jesus. Certainly the Bible and life of Jesus speak to us more directly, but creation has much to say also. City life today surrounds us with the man-made. Take time to see the beauty of His creation, and let it speak to you of his eternal power and divine attributes.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Use illustrations from creation to understand life. Jesus did.</p>
