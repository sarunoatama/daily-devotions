<p>Genesis 28:15 (NIV) <i><sup>15</sup>I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jacob had bought his brother's birthright and stolen his blessing. As he fled from his brother Esau, he had an encounter with God at Bethel. There, God promised many things to this rascal. Nothing is really asked of Jacob. True, Jacob valued the blessing but went about obtaining it in an ungodly manner. Once God had expressed the blessing and promises to Jacob, Jacob went about cutting a deal. Allow me to paraphrase it. "OK, if you protect, feed, clothe me, and get me back here safely, tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a tenth and worship you here. Then I'll adopt you as my god." (I use the little "g" intentionally.)</p>
<p class="indent">How patient God is with us! Jacob had just been told how blessed he was, in spite of his deceptions, received promises he didn't deserve, and then he talked to God as if God needed him! If we will look deep within our own heart, we will find the same is often true of us and our requests of God. He has given us promises as great as the ones He gave to Jacob, and we still wheel and deal with Him as if He should be grateful for our worship.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Oh Lord, open our eyes to who You are and all that You have promised us. Help us to worship and adore You and ask in humble gratitude only the things that are in your will for your glory and honor.</p>
