<p>Mark 5:27-29 (NIV) <i><sup>27</sup>When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, <sup>28</sup>because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed." <sup>29</sup>Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering</i></p>

<p class="indent">There is more going on here than meets the Western eye. This woman had a case of perpetual bleeding. Not only was it debilitating, but according to the Jewish law she was considered unclean and supposed to shout out that fact when she was in public. Jesus was in a packed crowd, but this woman was desperate. She had spent her living on doctors that had not helped her. She had gone without human contact for years and was physically and emotionally drained. Jesus was her last hope.</p>
<p class="indent">The Jews had the idea that when the Messiah came, the tassel that hung from the corner of His cloak would heal those who touched it. It is not clear in Mark that this is what she was touching, but the word is clear in Matthew. It is the word that is translated 'hem' or 'tassel' in NIV. Jesus told the Pharisees that they made this part of their garments long. (Matthew 23:5) It is as if they were saying, "Perhaps I am the Messiah." When the woman thought, <i>"If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed"</i>, she was expressing her conviction that Jesus was the Messiah.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people were touching Jesus in that crowd, jostling up against Him. Jesus stopped and said that someone had touched Him. He perceived power flow from Him. What was the difference between this woman's touch and the crowds' touch? She had faith. Faith grounded her like a lightening rod. Everyone else was insulated by unbelief. The believing touch drew the power that made her whole.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: When you go to Jesus in prayer, reach out in faith and touch Him. Pound your lightening rod of faith deep into the earth, grab hold and with the other hand touch the Savior. Then, look out! The power will flow.</p>
