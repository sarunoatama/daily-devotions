<p>2 Chronicles 19:9-10 (NIV) <i><sup>9</sup>He gave them these orders: "You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD. <sup>10</sup>In every case that comes before you from your fellow countrymen who live in the cities&#8211;whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law, commands, decrees or ordinances&#8211;you are to warn them not to sin against the LORD; otherwise his wrath will come on you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not sin.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jehoshaphat appointed judges according to the Law of God and ordered them to act in the fear of God, not taking bribes, and to always be impartial. He warned them that they were not judging for men but for God who placed them in their positions. We could say the same for any Christian in any activity. We should all do our work in the fear of God, knowing that we represent Him and not ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Then Jehoshaphat gave them the instructions in our text for today. Serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD. Whatever work we are called to we, too, should serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD. Is that how you would describe your work ethic? If it is, God is glorified in your work.</p>
<p class="indent">The fear of the LORD is rarely mentioned today. The judges were supposed to make judgments in the fear of the LORD and to warn people that the wrath of God would come upon those who sin against the LORD. The fear of the LORD and His judgments were motivating factors of that day. Because we have a greater revelation of the love of God, should the fear of the LORD motivate us any less? I believe they should go hand in hand. As we read of kings whose hearts turned away from God and faced defeat and disease, we should recognize that it is love that brings wrath for the purpose of turning us. We should do all things in the fear of the LORD. That is having a healthy respect for His holiness and His Fatherly love.</p>
