<p>1 Samuel 26:10, 24 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "the LORD himself will strike him; either his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>24</sup>As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and deliver me from all trouble."</i></p>

<p class="indent">David learned from his experience with the wicked Nabal, that the LORD is more than capable of dispensing justice. He learned from his past experience and applied it to his present circumstance. That is something we all need to do. In verse 10, David's friend wanted to kill the sleeping Saul. This is the second time God had delivered Saul into David's hands, but he left vengeance to God. He will let the LORD take care of him.</p>
<p class="indent">David knew that the way he treated the king, others would treat him when he became king. He believed in the law of sowing and reaping. If he was faithful to obey the LORD in not harming Saul, God would preserve his life. We see that in the New Testament lesson of the measuring cup. The same measure you use toward your brother will be used toward you. If you use a spoon of grace toward others, you will receive a spoon back from them and from God. David looked for the biggest measure of grace and mercy he could find, for he wanted that from others and from God. He certainly would be in need of it in the future, and he did receive it. To think you won't need it is foolish. Be gracious toward those who have wronged you, and the LORD will be gracious to you.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help me to trust You to deal with those that do me wrong.</p>
