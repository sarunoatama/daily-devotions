<p>Psalms 8:3-5 (NIV) <i><sup>3</sup>When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, <sup>4</sup>what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him? <sup>5</sup>You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The clear night sky is awe-inspiring. One of my favorite places is a canyon lake far from big cities. The night sky appears to be entirely filled with stars. The band of the Milky Way glows with the light of a million stars. We count the shooting stars until we fall asleep. Now we know so much more about the enormity and complexity of that night sky than David did. It should awe us even more when we consider that our God set all that in place. He decreed the laws by which it all functions. Man is increasingly wondering at the mysteries and beauty we see there.</p>
<p class="indent">Considering that seemingly infinite space and vast number of worlds, what is man that God is mindful of us? He thinks of each of us continually. Why? What a great priority He has placed upon us as small as we are. He made us a little lower than <i>elohim. </i>The Hebrew word is used for God or angelic beings, and that is why you find some variations in the translation. You could say <i>"a little lower than God"</i>, since we will judge angels and they are sent to minister to us. The author of Hebrews chose "angels". Either way, it seems that David is in awe of the position God has given man in the order of creation. As small and insignificant as we seem, He has put great priority on us, crowning us with glory and honor.</p>
<p class="indent">That makes our sin all the more abhorrent. To think that we would rebel against the Almighty, our Maker, who gave us such a lofty position, shows the depravity of our ingratitude. What is man? We are so honored and offered such glory that our minds can scarce conceive it. Look up into the night sky.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: How should I respond to such a gracious and loving God?</p>
