<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>June 8</h1>
<p>2 Samuel 16:1-2 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him. He had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine. <sup>2</sup>The king asked Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the desert."</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Remember Ziba? He was Saul's servant. David appointed him and his family to be servants of Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth. After all the kindness and mercy that David showed Mephibosheth, he turned on him, hoping to inherit Saul's throne. Ziba was loyal to David. David's young children and wives needed animals to ride so that they could keep up. Ziba provided them and food to nourish them all on the journey. What David could not prepare on the short notice with his sudden flight, God provided from an unlikely source. We can know that when we are in the middle of calamity, God will provide.</p>
<p class="indent">It seemed unjust that Ziba and family had been freed when Saul died and then turned back into the servants of Saul's family. Nevertheless, they humbly submitted. Now they are free again. All Israel was choosing sides. Will you side with the Usurper or with the true King? The Usurper promises position and power, but he cannot deliver. You will find real freedom with hardship if you follow the true King. Your service will be rewarded for He is just and genuinely appreciative.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Every day we are tempted to succumb to the Enemy. He promises what he cannot deliver. Follow the true King, even when it is difficult.</p>
