<p>James 1:5-7 (NIV) <i><sup>5</sup>If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. <sup>6</sup>But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. <sup>7</sup>That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;</i></p>

<p class="indent">What a wonderful promise we have in this passage! We are always in need of divine wisdom. James says that all we need to do is ask, but he also encourages us that God doles it out generously. God does not only give it to the perfect, holy person, but to whoever would ask. He is just waiting for us to ask. Wisdom that is from above will lead us in the way of righteousness. That is why you don't have to have attained some state of perfection to ask for it. It is the path to a righteous life. It is a revelation of the ways of God.</p>
<p class="indent">Lest we think we can ask in any state of mind, James warns that the one thing that is required is to believe and not doubt. Perfection is not required, but belief is. God will not inspire you with wisdom when you will doubt the wisdom He is ready to give. The picture is of a wave blown and tossed by the wind.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not that you must attain to some great state of faith, but you need to believe in the character of God. If you ask and doubt what He gives, you will treat His wisdom with skepticism and be worse off than when you started. That is an indication of self-trust. Then, with your own wisdom, you will weigh what God has given as just one of many choices. That makes you more accountable for ignoring His direction. If you are going to ask for wisdom, believe it is coming and accept it without wavering. He is glad that you asked and glad to give it.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, I need Your wisdom each day of my life. Help me to understand what is of You and by faith to follow it explicitly.</p>
