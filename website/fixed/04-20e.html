<p>Mark 14:70-72 (NIV) <i><sup>70</sup>Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean." <sup>71</sup>He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about." <sup>72</sup>Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Peter, bold, blustery, confident Peter didn't run like most of the disciples. He followed Jesus to the home of Caiaphas. John was there too. John was known by the priestly family and not under the threat that the other disciples would have been. As Peter warmed himself by the fire, he could probably hear talk of taking this prisoner to Pilate for permission for execution. That was a dangerous place to be. Execution Roman style meant unspeakable pain, the most excruciating death imaginable. To sit there by that fire in the enemy's courtyard was really taking a chance. Peter had promised he would not leave Jesus alone, but then he was spotted. "Aren't you one of them? You have a Galilean accent."</p>
<p class="indent">The third denial came with curses, anything to get out of being caught right there and then. He denied any knowledge of Jesus. Then the rooster crowed just as Jesus had predicted. Luke wrote that at that moment Jesus turned and looked straight at Peter. Peter broke down. He was not as strong as he believed himself to be. Neither am I. Neither are you. Without Him we can do nothing. We can make all the oaths we want, but without His power we will never keep one of them.</p>
<p class="indent">Have you sat in that "courtyard"? I have. As I waited on a customer, they began to speak about the "born-againers". Would I remain silent and deny that I knew Him to remain in this person's favor? Silence is denial. When I stand to pray at the graduation, will I say the name of my Savior or give in to the demands that I use the generic "god". JESUS! What a name! It brings division. It stirs up emotions. If I remain silent, I should weep with Peter. The Lord turns to look at you and me also. Don't deny that you know Him. I hope our lives are a dead give away that we are one of His disciples. I hope there is enough evidence to convict us of being His.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help us not to deny You!</p>
