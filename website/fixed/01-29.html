<p>Exodus 3:2, 7 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>7</sup>The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The angel of the Lord is referred to by rabbi as the Prince of the Countenance. We know Him as Jesus, the visible manifestation of the invisible God. When Moses made his choice to side with his people, he had to flee for his life from the very people that had raised and educated him. In the wilderness of Midian, he received the second half of his training. Now he knows he can do nothing. He is humbled and ready to be called by God. Most of us would rather skip the last half of God's training, but it is essential. Without it we end up polluting what God would do with our own wisdom and ways. When Moses was ready, Jesus met with him.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the same Jesus of the New Testament that looks on people with compassion. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. (Hebrews 13:8) God said, <i>"I have seen their misery and heard them crying out..."</i> God is concerned about suffering wherever it takes place and to whomever as we saw in the story of Hagar. We are made in His image, and He loves and values each life.</p>
<p class="indent">It is argued that the God of the Old Testament brutally destroyed lives and therefore is not like the New Testament God. He does end life when it is so corrupt and perverted that it only inflicts pain. If you are experiencing a time of suffering, know that God sees your misery and hears your cries. He will bring a change or see you through it because of His great compassion.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: God is concerned about suffering and I should be also. His life in me will demonstrate His concerns.</p>
