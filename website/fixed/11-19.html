<p>Ecclesiastes 4:9-11 (NIV) <i><sup>9</sup>Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: <sup>10</sup>If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up! <sup>11</sup>Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?</i></p>

<p class="indent">Jesus sent his disciples out two by two. We need the companionship, fellowship, and encouragement of a partner. That friend will be a part of our greatest joys and deepest pains. We expect more from those with whom we share our hearts. Often, they will be the cause of the deepest pains, but the sharing of life's joys makes it worth it.</p>
<p class="indent">We all need a friend that we can share our heart with. We should always take our burdens to the Lord first, but it is often helpful to share them with that trusted friend also. They can give you a perspective that sees your situation through different eyes. They can encourage you and share their own similar experiences. Since we are to "do unto others as we would have them do to us," we should look for a friend that we can be all of the above to.</p>
<p class="indent">For most people, this companion will be their spouse. It takes a lot of work to get to this level of supporting one another in a marriage, but it is worth the effort. If you have settled for less, work through to a deeper relationship. Value your differences. Forgive and be willing to be hurt and forgive again, remembering that your spouse is enduring the same from you. The rewards of a deeper intimacy are more than worth it.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: There is a friend that sticks closer than a brother. Jesus told his disciples that He was going to call them friends. He wants a deeper intimacy with you. Let Him be your ultimate companion.</p>
