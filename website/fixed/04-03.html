<p>Deuteronomy 10:15-16 (NIV) <i><sup>15</sup>Yet the LORD set his affection on your forefathers and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations, as it is today. <sup>16</sup>Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer.</i></p>

<p class="indent">I love this expression, <i>"set his affection".</i> Not only has God set His affection on our forefathers in the faith, but He has set His affection on us. It was not anything good that we did. He sovereignly chose to set His affection on you! He loved you and chose you. So what should be your response?</p>
<p class="indent">Circumcise your hearts. Abraham had been given the ritual of circumcision confirming the covenant between God and himself. It was a physical illustration of an inner transformation that was to take place. This transformation is an act God is requesting us to do. "Make your heart tender toward me," God asks us. "Don't act like you don't hear when I call."</p>
<p class="indent">If we allow our hearts to be tender toward God, one word from Him and we will be at His feet waiting to hear what He has to speak to us. "Samuel, Samuel," God called out. Little Samuel had a circumcised heart. He heard. He responded. When God calls your name do you respond? Do you even hear Him call?</p>
<p class="indent">Once we have received His affection set upon us, realized His love and calling to us, we must respond by making our heart tender toward Him. We must respond by yielding our ear, by being quick to hear and respond. We can no longer go the way of our own choosing.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: God set His heart on me. What is my response?</p>
