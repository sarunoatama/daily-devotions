<p>Job 1:20-22 (NIV) <i><sup>20</sup>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship <sup>21</sup>and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised." <sup>22</sup>In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing</i></p>

<p class="indent">We can scarcely imagine all that calamity striking in one day, though some readers have had the one thing that was dearest to them taken. Losing all is losing all regardless if it is little or much. Surely Job's greatest loss was that of his children. To lose even one child is worse than imaginable. How do you react to adversity?</p>
<p class="indent">When we read Job's reaction, we see that God was correct in His assessment of Job. I've never seen anyone react without even a "Why God?" Job will come to that later. If you are wondering why Satan allowed his wife to live, it is because she told him to curse God and die. It was about to get even worse, as Satan does not wish to admit defeat and longed to turn Job against God.</p>
<p class="indent">Job's response was to worship. His answer is quoted at funerals, but it should be considered throughout our lives. We came into the world without physical things and we will leave without them. There has never been a moving van following a casket. The Egyptians tried, but all those treasures sit in museums. If our children go first, we will meet them one day, but our earthly treasures will go to others. Praise the name of the LORD. Praise Him for His wisdom in bringing us to the things that last and separating us from the temporal. How attached are you to the things that you will leave behind?</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: When we have a realization of the little value of earthly things, it is much easier to share them with others at the leading of God.</p>
