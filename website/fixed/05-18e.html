<h1><div class="part">Evening</div>May 18</h1>
<p>Luke 17:7-8, 10 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>"Suppose one of you had a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'? <sup>8</sup>Would he not rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'?</i></p>
<p><i><sup>10</sup>So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'"</i></p>

<p class="indent">The disciples asked Jesus to increase their faith. Jesus told them it wasn't how big your faith is, but that just having a little can do great things. He followed that with the supposition in our passage for today.</p>
<p class="indent">We are servants of the Most High God. We should be daily doing what He directs us to do. It may be providing for our family or serving on a mission field. Whatever we do, we do it to the best of our ability to glorify God. When our main service for the day is over, we do not turn around and ask God to serve us. We are the servants even if we are friends. He is God; we are creatures. He asks us to do another act of service and we joyfully submit. It is our pleasure to serve such a gracious and loving God.</p>
<p class="indent">In this service we can expect His assistance. He will not act against us when we are serving, but on our behalf. He will supply the tools and time and anything else necessary to carry out His request. That is faith. It is believing in our relationship and His ability. It is a lack of faith to plead for Him to serve us, as He will always care for His servants.</p>
<p class="indent">When a great thing comes to pass because we obeyed, we don't deserve any credit or commendation. We were just doing what we were instructed to do, and all the impossible things were done by our Master. Faith is just doing our duty. It is required of servants. Growing in faith is to grow in the realization of our relationship. If we know we are serving the Almighty, we know He will enable us to complete what He asks us to do. What a great honor to serve the Lord of all!</p>
