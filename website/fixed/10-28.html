<p>Psalms 118:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>The LORD is with me; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? <sup>7</sup>The LORD is with me; he is my helper. I will look in triumph on my enemies. <sup>8</sup>It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man.</i></p>

<p class="indent">We have come to the center of the Bible. Here is the core of it all. The LORD is with those who call on Him in truth. If the Creator of heaven and earth is with you, what have you to fear? Throughout Scripture, God's promise to those who sought Him was, "I will be with you." As long as the LORD is with us, we can be certain that things will turn out in the end. Emmanuel, God with us. It is an incredible thing that God would dwell with man, but He always has and He always will, for He has set His love on us.</p>
<p class="indent">The world will always look to man, man's wisdom, man's counsel, and man's strength. That often sets believers at odds with the world. But why fear or be concerned? What is the worst man can do to you? As the Apostle Paul said, (forgive my loose paraphrase) "If you kill me, I get to go home to be with Jesus. If you beat me, I just keep laying up treasures in heaven. Take your pick, either way the LORD is with me and I get blessed."</p>
<p class="indent">The enemies of the LORD will be defeated, but even now, I am more than a conqueror. I'm a mega-conqueror, because the LORD is with me! Because He is with me I have the victory in life and in death. You can trust in men if you want, but that is a sucker bet. You will lose in the end, guaranteed. Or you can trust in the LORD. That is a guaranteed win. What is your situation in life today? Where are you placing your trust? I hope it is not in man and man's best, even if that man is you. The old expression, "You can only trust yourself", is pretty pathetic.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: Trust in God! Let Him be your helper. Let go of fear, and watch the God of all creation show you His way.</p>
