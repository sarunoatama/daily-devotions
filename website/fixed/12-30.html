<p>Daniel 7:21-22, 27 (NIV) <i><sup>21</sup>As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup>22</sup>until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>27</sup>Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.'</i></p>

<p class="indent">Daniel has given us many prophecies relating to the end-times. Just as Nebuchadnezzar's image ended with ten toes, the beasts of Daniel's vision end with ten horns. A horn is a symbol of power. A little horn rises up and plucks up three of the ten horns. This is the Antichrist. He makes war with the saints for three and a half years. (time, times, and half a time) The revelation of Jesus to John gives the same scenario. The saints throughout the world will be tortured and killed because they will not bow to the Antichrist and refuse to worship him. His freedom to do this is limited to a set amount of time.</p>
<p class="indent">When that time is up, the Ancient of Days (God) will come and pronounce judgment in favor of the saints. Then they will possess the kingdom. We already possess the Kingdom of God if we are in Christ. We already have the blessedness of that kingdom in our heart. The prophecy is speaking of the kingdoms of the world, as verse 27 makes so clear. Rule, power, and greatness will be given to God's people. Yet, it is still called His kingdom. That is because we are His. Just as we co-labor with Him now, we will co-labor with Him then.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: This world is our training ground for learning to work with God. How are you doing? Remember the parable in which Jesus told the steward who was faithful with a certain amount of money that he was now to rule over a certain number of cities? (Luke 19) Be faithful to serve Him now and you will be prepared to serve Him as ruler over cities then.</p>
