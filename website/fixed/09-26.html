<p>Psalms 2:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>"I have installed my King on Zion, my holy hill." <sup>7</sup>I will proclaim the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father. <sup>8</sup>Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Many of the psalms look forward in time to the first and second coming of Jesus. Because Jesus is referred to as 'the son of David', there are things written about Solomon that are ultimately fulfilled in Jesus.</p>
<p class="indent">In the second psalm, God is speaking to the nations of the world that refuse God's instruction. They rebel against His loving decrees. But God is not threatened at all. In fact, He laughs. If all the nations of the earth were to join together to fight against Him, it would not disturb His peace one bit. Then God declares where His sovereign will has placed all authority to rule, in His Son.</p>
<p class="indent">The Son was with God from the beginning, but there is a point in human history when he is born of a woman. The birth in Bethlehem was one of the most amazing and supernatural events to ever take place. God stepped into a human body. The Son was willing to set an example for man and redeem man through His own obedient death on the cross, so God has given Him the right to rule the kingdoms of the earth. One day He will no longer allow man to rebel. The freedom to mock God and His laws and cause the people to suffer will no longer be allowed. Those rulers who would rebel will face the rod of iron. Man keeps trying to make the perfect government. The perfect government is coming.</p>
<p class="comment">Meditation: The King of kings will be installed on Zion, God's holy hill, and will reign in righteousness. Are you letting Him rule in your heart today?</p>
