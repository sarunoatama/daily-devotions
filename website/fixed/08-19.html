<p>2 Chronicles 28:9-11 (NIV) <i><sup>9</sup>But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, "Because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven. <sup>10</sup>And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren't you also guilty of sins against the LORD your God? <sup>11</sup>Now listen to me! Send back your fellow countrymen you have taken as prisoners, for the LORD's fierce anger rests on you."</i></p>

<p class="indent">After Jotham died, his son Ahaz reigned. God gave the people a king that they deserved so that hardship would turn them back to Him. Ahaz' army was defeated by the Arameans. Their treasures were robbed, and many of the people went into captivity. Then the Northern Tribes inflicted heavy casualties and took two hundred thousand women and children captive and a great deal of plunder.</p>
<p class="indent">As the army of the Northern Tribes returned to their capitol Samaria, a prophet of God named Obed met them. The message from God was that their victory was due to God's anger against Judah, but they had gone overboard in executing it. God's question to them was this, "Aren't you also guilty of sins against the LORD your God?"</p>
<p class="indent">There are times when we find ourselves with the upper hand over those who oppose us, but we take it to the extreme. We should consider that it may not be so much that God is favoring us as God punishing them. God's justice is always tempered with mercy, but man's justice rarely is. We should consider that we could be in their shoes, and that we are to apply the Golden Rule. If we desire mercy, then we will act with a great deal more mercy. Aren't we also guilty of sins? The Northern Tribes showed great wisdom and fear of God when they listened to the prophet and returned the captives along with the spoils of war.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: How you act gives permission for others to act the same way toward you. God says, "To those who show mercy, I will be merciful." (Matthew 5:7; James 2:13)</p>
