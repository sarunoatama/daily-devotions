<p>Psalms 71:18-20 (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come. <sup>19</sup>Your righteousness reaches to the skies, O God, you who have done great things. Who, O God, is like you? <sup>20</sup>Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.</i></p>

<p class="indent">What difficulties will old age bring? What fears do you have of aging? Perhaps you are already there. God is with you. Just as He has been every day of your life, and if you have been walking with Him, you may find greater assurance and peace in your old age. Several saints have said that in their old age they do not have as many signs of God's presence because they had learned to walk by faith. Even so, He will not forsake you, even when your body lies in the grave.</p>
<p class="indent">The Psalmist asks for God's presence to pass on the stories of the power of God to the next generation. He wants to tell of all that he has seen God do during his life, as well as of his fathers. He wants all that will follow him to know of the power and might of God, of God's perfect righteousness, incredible acts, and incomparable greatness. Is that your desire, to pass on the testimony of Jesus?</p>
<p class="indent">Yes, God has made you see many bitter troubles, but they have all been for your good, to mold you into the image of His Son. Your last battle will be death, but don't fear. He has gone before you and defeated death. Your body will rise again, transformed, to meet your spirit in the air. You will forever be with Him. The Apostle told us to remind each other about this glorious end of the story. It helps us get through those many bitter troubles. It is a comfort to know it is all serving a great purpose with an ending that is beyond our wildest dreams.</p>
<p class="comment">Encouragement: Endure, aged brother or sister in the LORD. The best is soon to come.</p>
