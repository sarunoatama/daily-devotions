<p>Deuteronomy 18:14-15 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so. <sup>15</sup>The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The world seeks to know of the spiritual through the evil side. That way they are able to be 'spiritual' and yet indulge their evil nature. It is the same with New Age. There is no demand from a holy God to give up their immorality. There is no standard of a righteous God to which they must conform.</p>
<p class="indent">God told the Israelites through Moses that we were not to be like them. Instead they were to watch for the prophet that God was going to raise up. This prophet was going to show us truth of the spiritual realm without compromising with evil. This prophet would be like Moses. Moses was a deliverer. Moses was meek. Moses heard from God and brought God's word to the people.</p>
<p class="indent">God raised up that prophet, Jesus, from the Jewish nation. We must listen to Him. He has the words of eternal life. But unlike the worldly spiritual ways of self-indulgence, He says we must take up our cross daily and follow Him. He tells us that if we try to save our life we will lose it. No wonder people flock to other ways, ways that lead to death.</p>
<p class="indent">Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. He is the prophet that Moses said God would bring. We must listen to Him. His way is death to self that leads to life. The way of the sorcerer and diviner promises life, encourages indulgence in what it calls 'life', but leads to death.</p>
