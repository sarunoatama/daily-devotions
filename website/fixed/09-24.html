<p>Job 42:5-6 (NIV) <i><sup>5</sup>My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. <sup>6</sup>Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."</i></p>

<p class="indent">Job had been questioning God, but now it is God's turn to question Job. The substance of God's questions ask Job that if he lives in a world full of things beyond his understanding, why should he be able to figure out what God is presently doing in his life? Such a wonderful Creator should be trusted by His creation to do what is in their best interest.</p>
<p class="indent">Job entered into a new relationship with God. Up until that time he had heard of God through others lives and stories. Now he saw God with his own eyes. He has the same reaction that everyone does. He saw the holiness of God and by contrast, his wretched condition. But didn't God say Job was righteous? No, God said there was no one on earth like him (1:8). Compared to other men he is blameless and upright. Compared to God he is a sin sick man with a sin-infested nature. Job learned genuine humility from this encounter. The manifest presence of God blows away any deceptions of our own goodness. We need God's manifest presence in the church today to see our real condition.</p>
<p class="indent">God restored everything that Job had lost, and then doubled it. There is one notable exception. He had as many children as he originally had. Why is that? Why weren't they doubled? Besides being hard on his wife, they really were doubled. He never lost the first set of children. They merely moved to heaven before Job did. He now has 20 children, even though ten are in heaven. Things are not always as they appear. The book of Job is an exhortation to trust God no matter what you are going through.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: You may never know the reasons for certain trials and struggles, but you can be sure your Creator's character is impeccable. God will see you through, if you will continue to trust in Him.</p>
