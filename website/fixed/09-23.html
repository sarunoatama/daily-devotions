<p>Job 40:6-8 (NIV) <i><sup>6</sup>Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm: <sup>7</sup>"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. <sup>8</sup>"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Once Job had finished justifying himself, his three friends said no more. A younger man then spoke up. He told Job the thing that he had done wrong was to justify himself rather than God. The young man, Elihu, insisted that God's character was unquestionable.</p>
<p class="indent">Then God showed up. He had a few questions to ask Job. His questions served one purpose, to show that God is all-knowing and we are not. We can't question what He allows because we have so few facts. He sees every aspect in the past, present, and future. How dare we question the character of the Almighty who moment by moment gives us life!</p>
<p class="indent">If there was a sin in Job's response to his condition, it was to justify himself and thereby accuse God. In justifying himself, he was saying that God had made a mistake. True, his friends drove him to it, but he yielded to the temptation to make himself look good, and by contrast said that God was doing something wrong. <i>"Would you condemn me to justify yourself?" </i>God asked.</p>
<p class="indent">In times of difficulty, when we cannot understand the reason or purpose for the struggle in our lives, we can count on the integrity and justice of God. The one thing we dare not do is say God is unjust in His dealing with us. Would you discredit His justice? We must proceed in faith, knowing that our understanding is limited and His is infinite.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: God can take it when we question Him. He understands our weakness. Just don't push it too far, especially as a poor testimony before others. God may question you.</p>
