<p>Genesis 40:14 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.</i></p>
<p>41:1 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,</i></p>

<p class="indent">Joseph had dreams from God that predicted his brothers and parents would bow down to him. The dreams and his father's favoritism caused his brothers to envy him. The brothers sold their 17-year-old brother to slave traders. They concocted a deceptive story for their father saying that a wild animal had killed him. Meanwhile, in Egypt, Joseph was elevated to the chief servant over the household of his first master. When the master's wife wanted him sexually, he would not betray God or his master by yielding to her. Her false accusation landed him in prison.</p>
<p class="indent">In time, he rose to second in charge of the prison. The Pharaoh's butler and baker were confined there, and he interpreted their dreams. The butler's dream meant that he would be reinstated, and so, Joseph uttered the above Scripture. But when the butler was restored, he forgot his vow to tell Pharaoh about this young man, now 28 years of age. He had served faithfully for years as a slave and for more years in prison. We never read one word of complaint. Just when there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel, the butler forgot while Joseph remained in the royal prison.</p>
<p class="indent">The darkest hour is just before the dawn. I don't think he ever doubted the God given dreams, but it sure must have seemed hopeless at times. After these 14 years of servitude, anyone would be discouraged. Yet, this was God's college for kings. In one day, he went from being a servant of the jailer to the second highest position in all of Egypt, the greatest nation in the world.</p>
<p class="comment">Encouragement: Don't give up on the vision and promises of God. He will bring them to pass in His time and His way. God's ways are vastly different from man's ways.</p>
