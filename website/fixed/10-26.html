<p>Psalms 110:1-3 (NIV) <i><sup>1</sup>The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." <sup>2</sup>The LORD will extend your mighty scepter from Zion; you will rule in the midst of your enemies. <sup>3</sup>Your troops will be willing on your day of battle. Arrayed in holy majesty, from the womb of the dawn you will receive the dew of your youth.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This was the most quoted verse of Jesus. There are two different words for lord. The first (all capital) is Jehovah, the eternal God. The second is Adon, the Master. The conversation between God and Jesus is overheard and recorded by the psalmist. Eternal God says to Lord Jesus to sit at His right hand until He makes all His enemies a footstool. The Jews thought the second lord was referring to David.</p>
<p class="indent">It was most quoted right at the last few days of Jesus' earthly life. Jesus was looking forward to the promise of His Father, sitting at His right hand, watching God's sovereign will bring everything in submission to the Son. You and I are watching too, as the world does its best to have man make heaven on earth without success.</p>
<p class="indent">Verse 2 promises that Jesus' ruling scepter will go out from Zion and throughout the enemy camp. When He returns to reign, he will not come as the humble servant. He will come as the majestic Lord of glory, and we will follow as warriors in our prime, enforcing His rule in the earth. Perhaps Jesus quoted this so often because He wanted us to look forward too, and to understand that this transition period is only for a short time. With our eyes set on this future, we have a very different perspective of our present. Our destiny is to rule and reign with Him in righteousness. All the troubles of our present day will be past.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The world will see with their own eyes the glory of the Lord of all the earth. Every knee will bow and every tongue confess that He is Lord!</p>
