<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>August 11</h1>
<p>2 Chronicles 20:2-4 (NIV) <i><sup>2</sup>Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, "A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from the other side of the Sea. It is already in Hazazon Tamar" (that is, En Gedi). <sup>3</sup>Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the LORD, and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah. <sup>4</sup>The people of Judah came together to seek help from the LORD; indeed, they came from every town in Judah to seek him.</i></p>

<p class="indent">In spite of Jehoshaphat's lack of discernment, he knew what to do in time of trouble. This is a model chapter in how to face difficulty in our lives. Instead of running to his generals, he ran to the LORD. He resolved to inquire of the LORD. When we are alarmed, we will run to where our trust is placed. He proclaimed a fast. The people of the nation came together to seek God. From every town they came to seek Him.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to learn a lesson from this. We often put our heads together to come up with a solution. We are great at running to friends to ask for advice, like Rehoboam did. We even grab a book like, "How to Deal with Troubled Teens". What we need to do is be resolved to inquire of the LORD. When we do, those under our influence will also. Jehoshaphat's good example led the nation down the only path that would save them. Believe it or not, America has had a nationally declared day of prayer and fasting in its history, too.</p>
<p class="indent">Once they decided they would wait upon God, He spoke to them! First, Jehoshaphat led them in a prayer in which he laid the situation before God. He declared that power belonged to God. He confessed their weakness and ignorance and that their eyes were upon God. Then they stood before the LORD with their wives and children and waited. What an example for us today! We need to learn to wait on the Lord. God spoke through Jahaziel. God said the battle was His, and He gave them their marching orders.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord God, help us to learn to turn to You first, recognize our need, and wait until we get Your answer.</p>
