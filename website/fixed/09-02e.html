<p>1 Corinthians 12:7, 11, 18 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>11</sup>All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines.</i></p>
<p><i><sup>18</sup>But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This chapter is about the gifts of the Spirit. Various denominations and schools of doctrine interpret what is meant by each gift differently, but there is one thread running through the teaching on gifts that seems to be the main point. Whatever the gift, it is for the common good. It is to build up others in the body of Christ. We are dependent on one another just as a body is dependent on its other parts.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever the gift, it is distributed as the Spirit sees fit. All gifts are from the same Spirit, so gifts are not going to be opposing other gifts. Together, the gifts are for a whole and healthy body. We can ask for the more beneficial gifts, but God is the One who arranges the parts as He desires. He sees the whole picture and knows who needs what gift in what fellowship.</p>
<p class="indent">We have run into a great deal of trouble in the modern church by insisting we all have the same gift. Some churches believe everyone has the gift of evangelism, while others believe everyone has the gift of tongues. There are a diversity of gifts distributed as God sees fit for the common good. Some of the less noticeable gifts are the most needed and therefore the most common. Just because your gift is not the showiest, don't think it is not as important to the body as the one who speaks forth the word. Without you, the body would be handicapped. Understanding how and why God distributes the gifts makes it important for us to find a place of fellowship where we are ministered to and can use our gift.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Have you found your place in the body and become a functioning member yourself? That is God's plan for you.</p>
