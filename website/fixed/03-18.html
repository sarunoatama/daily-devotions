<p>Deuteronomy 4:7-8 (NIV) <i><sup>7</sup>What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the LORD our God is near us whenever we pray to him? <sup>8</sup>And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?</i></p>

<p class="indent">Our God fills the universe, and yet He is near everyone, ready to commune with hearts that are receptive to Him. He is over all and yet willing to have a personal relationship with those who seek Him in truth. There has never been a god invented by any religion that is so great and so loving as the God of the Bible. We did not invent our God. He revealed Himself to us. He continues to reveal Himself to us as long as we continue to seek the wonder of His infinite greatness.</p>
<p class="indent">Though Israel was a nation with the privilege of seeing Him move on their behalf, all the nations that came in contact with Israel could witness the same and decide if they wanted to pursue the God of Israel. He would be just as near any of them that sought Him whenever they prayed to Him.</p>
<p class="indent">What really made Israel unique was that they had the recorded word of God. The laws that they received were full of the Creator's instructions that kept them from the diseases and injustices that the nations around them experienced. The revealed Word gave them a new culture, the culture of God. Even the culture was meant to be a witness to the nations.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Appreciate the fact that you have a God that is near when you pray. Appreciate your unique culture by living as a person of the Word. Both will speak to the world you come in contact with and show that there is a Living God who is near those who call upon Him.</p>
