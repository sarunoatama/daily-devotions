<p>1 Samuel 18:3-4 (NIV) <i><sup>3</sup>And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. <sup>4</sup>Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.</i></p>

<p class="indent">One of the ancient covenants that remained from tribal days was this one that Jonathan entered into with David. Jonathan had the same heart of faith in God and His ability to defeat the enemies in life. When he heard David speak, his soul resonated with the same tone of faith and courage in God. He loved him as himself. He saw his own heart toward God in David. You may have felt something like this when you heard a brother or sister share their testimony.</p>
<p class="indent">This covenant took the form of the exchange of clothing and weapons. It was, in symbolic style, saying that my possessions are yours and your enemies are mine. It is not recorded that David gave his clothes and weapons to Jonathan, but as a person of lower class and wealth, he had already committed himself to the royal family. They had entered into a covenant to defend and provide for one another.</p>
<p class="indent">It is a wonderful gift of God when you find someone that shares your heart for ministry. They come along side you with understanding and encouragement, and you do the same for them. This is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, who became a man, the last Adam, in order to come along side us. He took off his robe of glory and weapons of power to be with us. We give Him our weak and meager allegiance and He gives us His clothing of glory and weapons of light. We have entered into a friendship covenant, promising to fight side by side against our common enemy.</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help me be as faithful to You as David was to Jonathan! Thank you for those who share my heart for You.</p>
