<p>Song of Songs 2:14-15 (NIV) <i><sup>14</sup>My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places on the mountainside, show me your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. <sup>15</sup>Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Song of Songs is about a love relationship between Solomon and a young woman. In a type or shadow it is about Jesus (the Son of David) and His bride, the church. The church is a made up of many members, and this speaks to us all. But it also speaks to us individually. The Apostle Paul tells us in Ephesians 5 that marriage is a mystery that represents Christ and the church. As you read the Song of Songs, place yourself in the role of the beloved. Let the words of the Lover speak to your heart. We consider the love of Christ expressed on the cross, but we should also consider that relational love that made Him willing to go there.</p>
<p class="indent">In this passage, He calls you His dove. He wants to see your face. To Him, your face is lovely. He longs to hear your voice, for He considers it to be sweet. Our flesh and blood body will pass away, and we will have new bodies that are a clearer expression of our spirit. (1 Corinthians 15:51,52; 1 John 3:2) He sees that now in you. He sees past the passing and to the eternal. Take time to come out of hiding in all your busyness, and come and talk with Him face to face.</p>
<p class="indent">In this song, the Lover and his beloved both have vineyards. It represents the fruit of their lives. Little foxes come in to spoil the fruit. The Lover and his beloved are going to see that those things that keep their lives from being fruitful are eliminated. What is it that keeps your life from being fruitful? Are you planning to eliminate it?</p>
<p class="comment">Prayer: Lord, help me to be completely Yours. Help me see and catch those things that keep our relationship from being fruitful.</p>
