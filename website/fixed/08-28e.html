<p>1 Corinthians 6:18-20 (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. <sup>19</sup>Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; <sup>20</sup>you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The world cannot understand why Christians are so concerned about sexual sin. Indeed, we seem to be overly concerned about the sexual sins of the world when they know no better. The Apostle Paul helped the Corinthians, who lived in a very immoral society, to understand why it was important for them to avoid this type of sin. Sexual sins affect your body. The Christian's body is supposed to be dedicated to God like the vessels of the Temple, for holy use. When it is used for sexual sin, it is defiling the temple of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">He warned them to flee from sexual immorality. The best way to avoid temptation is to run from it. If you linger around temptation, eventually it will get to you. Don't just walk away, run! Sexual immorality, while capturing your body, will also capture your thought life. Compromise becomes the rule instead of the exception. It is very similar to drug addiction. Once it has your body, it is very difficult to be free again. That is why the Apostle tells us to flee from it.</p>
<p class="indent">Obedience in this regard is in your own best interests, but Paul adds that we should be thinking of Christ's interests. He bought you. He paid the highest price that could be paid, because it was Satan's asking price. Since you were redeemed from being his slave and are now Christ's servant, honor God with your body. Sexual immorality dishonors the One who paid such a high price for you. If you are in sexual sin, or lingering near the temptation of it, stop and consider the cross. Would you dishonor that by yielding your body to immorality? Then consider how you can flee from it. Take practical steps. Find a trustworthy friend to keep you accountable.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: The cost of giving in is higher than you can imagine. Glorify God with your body.</p>
