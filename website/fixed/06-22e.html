<p>John 12:48-50 (NIV) <i><sup>48</sup>There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day. <sup>49</sup>For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. <sup>50</sup>I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."</i></p>

<p class="indent">The word of Jesus is the word of God. That is why the words of Jesus will judge mankind. When we hear those words we are hearing our Maker. Then we must decide if we will accept or reject the truth of those words.</p>
<p class="indent">What an incredible example He set for us in that every word was straight from the Father in the way that the Father would have Him say it. His reputation then was tied to that of the Father. To condemn His words was to condemn the Father. To reject Him was to reject the Father. As you read the Word, remember that every word from Christ is straight from the Father, and you must decide whether you will receive or reject them.</p>
<p class="indent">The more we walk in the Light, the less there is of us to dislike or like. Our reputation and testimony is increasingly tied to that of the Father. Jesus wasn't personally offended when people rejected His words, because they were the Father's words. As we decrease, and He increases in us, we will find there is no need to defend our reputation. If we will follow His example of saying the Father's words the way the Father shows us, we can have the same freedom to accept rejection.</p>
<p class="indent">Does rejection from people trouble you? Increasingly seek to speak the words of the Father that the Holy Spirit brings to your mind the way He would have you say them, and you can find freedom from that fear.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: It takes time at Jesus' feet to hear what He would have us say and how to say it.</p>
