<p>John 3:19-21 (NIV) <i><sup>19</sup>This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup>20</sup>Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup>21</sup>But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God."</i></p>

<p class="indent">God is a just God. He will deal with men according to the revelation of the truth they have seen. John the Beloved told us in the first chapter that everyone sees the light of God. Some would personally witness His miraculous life or hear about it from those who did. We have had a revelation of the light of reality through the message passed down to us in the Gospels. Some of us have had a personal revelation of the Light. Then comes the choice of what we will do with what we have seen and heard. If there was no revealing of light, we would not be accountable, but that is not the case.</p>
<p class="indent">The revelation of Light will have one of two affects. The light always draws you to the truth. Then we either desire it or hate it. That is usually evident in the lifestyle we choose. If we cling to self and our own ways, we will avoid the Light. When the Light comes to visit via believers, those who love darkness are repulsed by it. They will find excuses to hate the bearer. That is why lovers of darkness will find friends who love it, and those who love the light will gather with others who love light.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who love the Light continue to come to the Light. They do not want to be deceived and go on in the darkness of their own ways. Instead, they want to be certain that what they do is done through God, so they are continually coming to the Light. Do you come to the Light of God in His word, prayer, and fellowship to discern if what you're doing is of selfish origin or of God?</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: The Light makes everything plain. Walk in the Light.</p>
