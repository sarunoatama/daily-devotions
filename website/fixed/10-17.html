<p>Psalms 66:10-12 (NIV) <i><sup>10</sup>For you, O God, tested us; you refined us like silver. <sup>11</sup>You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs. <sup>12</sup>You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Becoming a Christian does not mean that all trials will cease and life suddenly become as smooth as it can be On the contrary, throughout Scripture we see God's people enduring great trials that nearly crush them. Paul the Apostle promised that if we suffer with Him, we will reign with Him.</p>
<p class="indent">What is this difficult life we are called to all about? God is refining us. In the Father's eyes, the work is done, but here on earth as we live out our day-to-day life, we find our old nature is trying to reestablish its ways in us. It was our familiar pattern, and one into which we would easily slip. Through the difficult situations we face, God reveals to us the old ways that we are tempted to cling. If we try them again, we find they are contrary to our new life. It is like the refining of a metal. The heat brings up the lighter contaminants so that they can be removed. One old silversmith said that he knew that the silver refining process was finished when he could see his reflection in the silver. God is looking for His reflection in you.</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, God brings us out into a place of abundance. For many, that will not be in this life. You may have to wait for eternity, what a place of abundance. Those who died in faith and did not receive the promises in this life will go to a better reward, writes the author of Hebrews. Many wonder about the expression <i>"filling up the sufferings of Christ".</i> As a part of His body, your sufferings in the process of refinement, are a part of that mystical suffering. Jesus suffers with you for you are a part of His body; when one member hurts, all the members suffer, including the head. You are not alone in your suffering. Let the Comforter comfort you.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider the eternal great reward and endure by the grace of God. He will bring you out into a place of abundance!</p>
