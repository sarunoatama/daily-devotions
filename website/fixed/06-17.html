<p>1 Kings 11:4 (NIV) <i><sup>4</sup>As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.</i></p>
<p class="blankline"><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Solomon started with a heart after God. He had learned from his father, David, that God was worthy of all our praise. The blessing of God was upon Solomon, and he was probably the wisest and wealthiest king to ever live. But in prosperity, there is great danger. He had a weakness for women. He married women from the countries that the Lord had forbidden the Israelites to marry. God had warned in the Law that if there should be a king over Israel, he was not to multiply to himself many wives. God warned that wives of other nations would turn his heart from the true God.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a number of warnings for us in this sad account of the demise of Solomon. The first is to pay attention to the word of God. We may think our abilities or gifts make us exempt from some passage or direction. We may justify our sin in any number of ways, but we will suffer for disobedience. The warnings in the Word are for our own good.</p>
<p class="indent">Choose your mate carefully. Your mate will, over time, affect your relationship with God. You may think you can win them, or that you will not be affected, but two do become one. There has to be influence. If you are already in a marriage with an unbeliever, pray! Pray for strength to stand firm in your faith. Pray for opportunities to help turn your mate's heart. Look for the leading of the Holy Spirit to share God's love for them.</p>
<p class="indent">We see in this passage that God is after a fully devoted heart, not a heart of compromise. In our old age, when we are slowing down from everything, we are tempted to slow down on our wholehearted devotion. Don't go there! Finish strong. Endure to the end. Have a heart like David!</p>
