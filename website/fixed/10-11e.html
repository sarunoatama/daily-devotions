<p>Philippians 3:8-10 (NIV) <i><sup>8</sup>What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ <sup>9</sup>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ&#8211;the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith. <sup>10</sup>I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</i></p>

<p class="indent">Paul had a lot of worldly things to boast about. His education was among the best. His discipline and pedigree were impeccable, but he considered it all to be garbage. He had learned that the things man is in awe of had only led him to deception. But he went on to say that he considered everything a loss when compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ. He didn't just say it but actually experienced the loss of all things in pursuit of knowing Christ more intimately.</p>
<p class="indent">Every work, every diploma, every genealogy, everything, he considered garbage! All he desired was to be found in Christ. In Him, there is a righteousness that is unattainable by any other man. Can you hear the passion in Paul's writing to be right with God? He finally found the way to the righteousness he sought. It was to be in the One who declared Himself to be the Way.</p>
<p class="indent">Verse ten is a description of that passion. Read it again and again, and ask yourself if you have found that passion. It is a passion that is only derived from the Holy Spirit at work in us. It can't come from any effort of man, or any instruction, or discipline. It is a work of grace in a heart that has been plowed deep.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Can you say with Paul and all the saints that have laid down their rights to be found in Christ, <i>"I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death..."</i>? If not, ask for God to work that desire into your heart. Ask that your heart be deeply plowed and all other desires to fall away. God will answer.</p>
