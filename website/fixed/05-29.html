<h1><div class="part">Morning</div>May 29</h1>
<p>2 Samuel 6:14-16 (KJV) <i><sup>14</sup>And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. <sup>15</sup>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. <sup>16</sup>And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Once David saw that the home in which he left the ark was blessed, He decided to go ahead and bring it to the tabernacle in Jerusalem. This time, he had it carried correctly by the priests. Arriving in Jerusalem, he was so overjoyed that he leaped and danced in only an ephod. An ephod was a worshipper's vest that was highly decorated. It may have come down to the waist or have covered the hips. Either way, his leaping and dancing about must have exposed him. Michael, Saul's daughter, saw her husband dancing before the LORD with the women of Jerusalem looking on and became very jealous. She put a damper on David's joy by rebuking him when he came to bless her. She despised him and became barren.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a great variety of worship styles in the church today. Some would get almost as wild as David. The conservatives despise them because of it. If it is to the LORD, and only God can judge that, the conservative camp better be careful that they do not end up barren like Michael. If they are worshipping the LORD with all their heart and focused upon Him, they are pleasing the heart of God. You don't have to be expressive to worship with all your heart, but it doesn't hurt to be expressive.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>"Who are we to judge another man's servant"</i>, the Apostle Paul wrote. The worshipper is God's servant, and whatever style he worships in, God will be the judge as to whether or not it was appropriate. Man judges according to appearance but God judges the heart.</p>
<p class="indent">However you worship, let's catch the excitement that David had for the presence of God within us. Never be complacent about that.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: The Presence is in a tent today too, the tent of your body. Leap for joy!</p>
