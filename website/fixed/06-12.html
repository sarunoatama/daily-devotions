<p>1 Kings 3:5,9 (NIV) <i><sup>5</sup>At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream, and God said, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you." <sup>9</sup>So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?"</i></p>

<p class="indent">Solomon began his reign with a heart seeking God. After offering 1000 sacrifices upon the high place of Gibeon, the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream promising him whatever he would ask.</p>
<p class="indent">Of all the things Solomon could have desired, he asked for a discerning heart, wisdom to rule God's people. He recognized his need for discernment. This pleased the heart of God. He was then told that he would also receive the things man would normally ask for, riches, long life, and the death of his enemies.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</i> Isn't seeking the kingdom seeking the good of the people in it? Solomon was thinking of others and not himself. It is sad that his heart did not remain in this condition, but at the time it was genuine.</p>
<p class="indent">We have here both the good example of seeking the best for the people of God, and the warning to be careful that we do not turn our attention to pleasing ourselves. If you will seek the good of others, God will see that you are taken care of, and you will be laying up treasures in heaven.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider what you would ask God for.</p>
