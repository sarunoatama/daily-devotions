<p>Joshua 4:23-24 (NIV) <i><sup>23</sup>For the LORD your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The LORD your God did to the Jordan just what he had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over. <sup>24</sup>He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the LORD is powerful and so that you might always fear the LORD your God."</i></p>

<p class="indent">When Israel was prepared to cross, the Levites carried the ark into the Jordan River at flood stage. As soon as their feet touched the water it rolled back like the time they crossed the Red Sea. The Levites stood there with the ark while the whole nation crossed. Then a man from each tribe picked a stone out of the riverbed to make a memorial. When the ark was carried to the other side, the water returned to flood stage.</p>
<p class="indent">It's humorous to hear people try to give physical reasons as to why that happened. I think they are desperate to say it wasn't an unexplainable miracle. Does it really matter? It would be just as great a miracle if some physical event caused it at the very moment the feet of those carrying the ark touched the water. It is as if we do not want to acknowledge that God can do anything He wants any time He wants. That thought makes God so much greater than we usually think of Him. It humbles us. Flesh doesn't like to be humbled.</p>
<p class="indent">God did it that way to show He is powerful and that you might always fear the Lord you God. God is on the throne of heaven and can do whatever He wills. Learn to love it now, because it will be that way forever.</p>
