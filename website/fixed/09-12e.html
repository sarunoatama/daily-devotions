<p>2 Corinthians 5:18,20-21 (NIV) <i><sup>18</sup>All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:</i></p>
<p><i><sup>20</sup>We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God. <sup>21</sup>God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Paul has been writing about the wonder of Christ transforming our lives and preparing us for eternity. He knew he had laid up his treasure there and would prefer to leave and be with Christ. Now he adds that this is all from God. It is not his work but Christ in him. We are sent to help people find a right relationship with God. As we share the work of Christ and encourage them to surrender to His love, we all become ministers of reconciliation. The damage that was done through Adam and our own choices must be reconciled if we are to spend eternity in His presence.</p>
<p class="indent">That is why we are Christ's ambassadors. The word is literally 'elders', but the context shows that 'ambassadors' was a good choice of words. We go out representing God, making His appeal to man. We plead with people, imploring them to be made right with God.</p>
<p class="indent">It is such an incredible offer! There is a ledger of debt and credit in every life. Sin adds to the debt side. When we first hear God's offer through one of His servants, we realize we only come with debts, insurmountable ones at that. He shows us the ledger of Christ. He has no debts, but His credit page is full, credit beyond our imagination, the righteousness of God. Then he offers to change the names on the ledger, yours for Jesus of Nazareth. Yes, He will take your huge debts, and in return, give you His ledger of incredible credit. Blind to the reality of sins destructiveness, some will reject the offer. They realize that in the exchange, they will become a new creation with a new Master. They look back at their debt producing bondage and find some pleasure in it. But some will take the offer.</p>
<p class="comment">Remember: You are an ambassador. Share the wonderful process of reconciliation.</p>
