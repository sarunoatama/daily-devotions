<p>Joshua 6:16-17 (NIV) <i><sup>16</sup>The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city! <sup>17</sup>The city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent.</i></p>

<p class="indent">What an unconventional battle plan the Commander gave to Joshua! We need to get our battle plans from the Lord. He knows how to go about it in a way that will bring Him all the glory. You know that when other people heard of how God brought victory over Jericho, in future wars, Israel had the psychological advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">In Israel's case, it was an expression of praise to God. In the battle Gideon led, they shouted, "The sword of the LORD and of Gideon." They probably shouted something similar here. When they did the walls fell inward and the army marched straight in.</p>
<p class="indent">Since this was the first city (firstfruits), and God was giving the victory, everything in it was to be dedicated to God. The gold and silver were to go into the treasury and everything else was to be burned. The promise of the spies to Rahab was carefully kept.</p>
<p class="indent">When you go into battle be sure and get your battle plans from the Commander. Give Him the praise and the glory for the victory. The honor is due Him. His way is the best way. Keep those promises you made along the way to the battle. Give to God what is God's.</p>
<p class="comment">Consider: Are you getting your battle plans from man or from the Commander in Chief?</p>
